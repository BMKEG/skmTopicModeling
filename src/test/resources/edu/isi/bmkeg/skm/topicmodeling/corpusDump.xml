Glial cell precursors, which include undifferentiated glioblasts, oligo-dendroblasts, and astroblasts, predominated in the first few days after birth, constituting 43% of the glial cell population, and then declined to less than 5% by 28 days. Light and dark oligodendrocytes differed morphologically in their electron density and the appearance of their organelles. Light oligoden-drocytes increased slightly prior to myelination, and then declined, whereas dark oligodendrocytes continued to increase throughout the 4-week period and became the predominant cell type at 28 days 66% . In contrast to the oligodendroglial population, the sizes of the astroglial and microglial cell populations were relatively stable. This study shows that the population of immature glial cell precursors, abundant at birth in the lateral corticospinal tract, appear to be differentiat-ing primarily into oligodendroglia, because this population exhibits a rapid increase in size, and relatively little change occurs in the astrocyte popula-tion. The trends in glial cell development in the dog are similar to those reported for rodents, although there may be some variation in the matura-tion and activity of oligodendrocytes. The glial cell populations in the vertebrate central ner-vous system undergo extensive developmental changes dur-ing the perinatal and postnatal periods. These changes include proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, and lead to an eventual myelination of most axons. Although trends are apparent in glial cell development, there are variations between different regions of the brain and spinal cord, and there may be species differences. In the optic nerve, both astroglia and oligodendroglia proliferate to a large extent after birth Vaughn, 69 Skoff, 76 Privat et al., 81 . In the spinal cord, the astroglial population ap-pears to be relatively more stable at birth, and the rapid increase in glial cell number has been attributed primarily to the proliferation of oligodendroglia Gilmore, 71 Mat- In studies of gliogenesis in the spinal cord, few have focused on the development of specific types of glia in dis-tinct fiber tracts Matthews and Duncan, 71 . In the spinal cord of a number of species, regional variations in the time of onset of myelination result in three tracts-the fasciculi gracilis and cuneatus, and the corticospinal tract-that my- elinate to a large extent after birth Hildebrand, 71 Matthews and Duncan, 71 . Because, in the dog, the corti-cospinal tract is the least myelinated at birth and develops slowly Fox et al., 711, it is a readily accessible region for the examination of changes in specific glial cell types throughout myelinogenesis. It also provides an ideal area in which to evaluate myelinogenesis in myelinating mu-tants, as the breakdown in the normal development of glia and myelin can be studied in a temporal sequence from very early stages onward. Such a myelin mutant where this approach would be useful i s the shaking pup Griffiths et al., 81 . Although gliogenesis has been studied exten-sively in rodents, to date there are no contemporary reports of myelin and glial cell development in the canine central nervous system. The only previous study of myelination in the dog has been done on paraffin-embedded material Fox et al., 71 . The present study was undertaken to provide a detailed analysis of both qualitative and quantitative changes in glial cells in the lateral corticospinal tract of the dog and to determine whether species differences occur from that de-scribed in the rat. An important consideration in this study is the method by which glial cells are quantified. Whereas many stereological formulae are based on the assumptions that nuclei are spherical and randomly oriented, the method used in this study DeHoff and Rhines, 61 accounts for the facts that glial cell nuclei may be elliptical, or irregular in shape, and that in the spinal cord glial cells are not ran-domly oriented, but are usually longitudinally oriented Sturrock, 83 . MATERIALS AND METHODSQuantitative measurements blocks oriented transversely with respect to the long axis of the spinal cord. Sampling of each animal was as follows 2 to 3 tissue blocks were chosen from the sixth cervical seg-ment. From each block, 4-6 levels grids , separated by 15-20 pm, were selected. From each grid, cells were counted from 4 grid squares overlying the LCST, and only cells displaying a clear nucleus that lay entirely within the sample grid square were counted and classified. The aver-age area of one grid square was 0.01 mm2. Two animals were sampled for days 4,5,8,12, and 19, whereas for the intervening days, 1 animal was sampled. The numerical nsity, Nv, was computed by dividing Na by D -t t, where D equals the mean projected diameter of the nucleus measured in a plane perpendicular to which the cells were counted, and t equals the section thickness. For the determination of D Fig. l , 15 serial thin sections were cut from tissue blocks oriented longitudinally, and electron micrographs prepared with a fin21 magnification of 6720X. The mean projected diameter D was measured on the electron micrographs by using a semiautomatic im-age analysis system BIOQUANT, r m biometrics inter-faced with an IBM PC. The largest of 8-20 10-length measurements was takenas an estimate of D for the cell nucleus. A mean of the D values was calculated for each glial cell type, and this factor was used in computation of the numerical density. Regression analysis and one-way analysis of variance were done to determine if the interage variation in glial cell density was significant compared to the intraage vari-ation, and if the quantitative changes in glial cell develop-ment were significant with respect to increasing age. Both interage variation in glial cell density and quantitative changes with respect to age were significant P 0.05 compared to differences found in measurements taken from age-matched animals. RESULTSQualitative observations of glial cells in the developing lateral corticospinal tract blasts and oligodendroblasts. Many cells encountered in the lateral corticospinal tract LCST of the youngest pups were difficult to classify as anything but glioblasts. These cells were small and exhibited a range of cytoplasmic densities, and the organelle content was sparse and poorly organized Fig. 2 . These glioblasts were similar in morphology to the free subependymal cells described by Ling et al. 731, and glioblasts described by Ling 76 and Sturrock 82 in the spinal cord. Adopting the criteria of Skoff 76 , astroblasts and oligodendroblasts could be identified in the developing LCST Fig. 3 . These cells were encountered most fre-quently between 4-10 days after birth, and oligodendro-blasts were more common than astroblasts. Figure 3a illus-trates an oligodendroblast in which the organelles are ran-domly arranged. The immature cells observed in the LCST closely resembled the dividing cells described by Meinecke and Webster 84 in the mouse spinal cord. Figure 3b shows a typical astroblast that has very electron lucent cytoplasm and few organelles. Glial filaments, a distinct feature of mature astrocytes, were not common in astroblasts. Mature glial cells. Oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and mi-croglia were easily distinguished at all ages in the devel-oping LCST. Oligodendrocytes in the LCST of the dog were divided into two groups, light and dark types. The light oligodendrocytes Fig. 4a,b resemble the large, light cells originally identified by Mori and Leblond 70 and the active oligodendrocytes described by Vaughn 69 , Mat-thews and Duncan 711, and Phillips 73 . The dark oligo-dendrocytes in the LCST of the dog Fig. 5a,b have a similar morphology to those previously described Mori and Leblond, 71 . Light oligodendrocytes extended multiple processes that contacted or ensheathed unmyelinated axons Fig. 4b . Dark oligodendrocytes frequently extended pro-cesses that were in direct continuity with mature myelin sheaths Fig. 5b , and they occasionally contacted unmy-elinated axons. Both light and dark oligodendrocytes ap-peared actively involved in myelination, which progressed slowly during the 4-week period Fig. 6 . Astrocytes Fig. 7 and microglia Fig. 8 showed less variability in their morphological characteristics than oli-godendrocytes. Astrocytes were consistently large, pale cells containing large aggregates of glial filaments in the cyto-plasm. Astroglial cells projected an extensive network of processes that appeared to course randomly throughout the neuropil of the LCST. Microglia had the same morphology as the resting microglia previously described in develop-ing white matter Phillips, 73 Peters et al., 76 . Quantitative observations of glial cells in the developing lateral corticospinal tract The number of cells measured and the mean projected -diameter D of glial cells are summarized in Table 1. When D measurements were determined for the glial cell popula-tion as a whole, a large spread in the data was evident Fig. 9 , reflecting the considerable differences in nuclear size for specific glial cell types. This large range in the nuclear lengths of individual glial cell types exemplifies the need for stereological correction of the original cell counts, since very large cells will be overestimated in number and very small cells will be underestimated Abercrombie, 46 . The I D of oligodendrocytes and precursors were 8.9 2.3 pm SD and 8.7 2.1 pm, respectively. The mean values for these cell groups fall closely within the mean range for the whole population 9.1 f 2.4 pm indicating that oligoden-drocytes and precursors represent the majority of the glial cell population in the LCST. Light oligodendrocytes 9.7 about 43% of the population. They fell to approximately 5-10% between 8-15 days, after which they comprised less than 5% of the population. In contrast to the developmental changes observed for the glial cell precursors, oligodendrocytes increased signifi-cantly with age P 0.05 . With the exception of precursors at 1-2 days of age, oligodendrocytes represented the largest percentage of the glial cell population. Oligodendrocytes comprised 38% of the population at birth and by the end of 4 weeks, more than 85% of the population. The rapid in-crease in the proportion of oligodendrocytes coincided with the onset of myelination in the LCST. When the oligodendrocyte population was divided into more specific subclasses, light oligodendrocytes 6 0 s and dark oligodendrocytes DOs , different developmental trends were revealed. There was no statistically significant differ-ence in the LO density over the 4-week period. In contrast, the DO density, which was lower than the LO density at birth, increased significantly P 0.05 . Light oligodendro-cytes accounted for 18-26% of the glial cell population in the first few days they peaked between 8-19 days 35-40% , and then slowly declined to about 20% at 4 weeks. In contrast, dark oligodendrocytes continued to increase from 10% at day 1 to 66% of the glial cells at 28 days. Astrocytes and microglia showed no significant P 0.05 change in density during the 4-week period. However, the percentage of astrocytes did increase from 11.5% of the population at 1 day to 21% between 10 and 15 days, but fell back to their initial level by 28 days. Microglial cells rep-resented a comparatively stable group of cells, never ex-ceeding 10% of the whole population in the maturing LCST. DISCUSSION Oligodendroglial cell development Our results show that in the lateral corticospinal tract of the dog, the density and proportion of oligodendrocytes increase dramatically in the first 4 weeks after birth. This increase in the oligodendroglial population coincides with a change in the morphological appearance of these cells, and with the onset of myelination. Similar observations have been documented extensively, especially in the rodent CNS Sakla, 65 Caley and Maxwell, 68 Privat, 73 Vaughn, 69 Mori and Leblond, 70 Gilmore, 71 Mat-thews and Duncan, 71 Ling et al., 73 Ling and Leblond, 73 Paterson et al., 73 Ling, 76 Skoff et al., 76a,b Im-mamoto et al., 78 Sturrock, 79, 82 Zagoren et al., 83 . We have also shown that in the first week after birth a large population of immature cells is present in the LCST. This population consists of three morphologically distinct cell types. Very small, ill-defined cells lacking processes, which we have called immature glial cell precursors, resem-ble the glioblasts reported in earlier studies Caley and Maxwell, 68 Ling, 76 Sturrock, 82 . In addition to the glioblastlike cells were those that could be reliably identi-fied as astroblasts and oligodendroblasts based on their greater size, the arrangement of their organelles, and the appearance of their chromatin. In the LCST the rapid increase in the number of glia is due primarily to the proliferation of oligodendroglia since neither the astroglial nor the microglial cell populations increase to nearly the same extent. Presumably the source of these new oligodendrocytes is the population of imma-ture glial cell precursors abundant at birth in the tract. This idea is consistent with the observation that the decline of the glioblast density closely parallels the increase in the oligodendrocyte density. It is possible that young oligo-dendroglia are migrating into the LCST from neighboring areas of the spinal cord. However, since astrocytes and microglia exhibit relatively little change in density, and cell death is not extensive 5% , it is reasonable to con-clude that the rapid decrease in the immature glial cell population is due to their differentiation into oligo-dendroglia. An important consideration with regard to glial cell de-velopment is whether this population of immature cells in the neonatal animal is multipotential. It has been sug-gested that in the postnatal animal, the majority of mitotic glial cell precursors found in developing white matter are differentiated Skoff et al., 76 . Recent work in tissue cul-ture has provided evidence that perinatal optic nerve cell cultures contain cells that can differentiate into astroglia or oligodendroglia depending on the culture medium Raff et al., 83 . This suggests that under in vitro conditions, these glial cells are multipotential. However, it is clear that cultured glial cells undergo a variety of morpholoyical changes Meller and Waelsch, 84 for reviews, see Wood and Bunge, 84 Debbage, 86 as a result of extraction and adaptation to the culture conditions. Hence it is with cau-tion that results from tissue culture work can be extrapo-lated to the behavior of glial cells developing under normal conditions. Our results do not imply whether the immature glial cells in the LCST are multipotential, but only suggest that the signal for their development in the neonatal dog is toward oligodendroglia. Differentiated oligodendrocytes are thought to undergo a maturation process in early postnatal and young adult ani-mals Mori and Leblond, 70 Privat, 73 Paterson et al., 73 Ling, 76 Paterson, 81 . These investigators have shown that three forms appear at different times during myelinogenesis, and that one type transforms into the next. Light oligodendrocytes appear prior to myelination, me-dium oligodendrocytes during active myelination, and dark oligodendrocytes appear after myelination is well under-way, and remain indefinitely. A distinction between light and medium oligodendrocytes was not possible in the LCST, and all the oligodendrocytes in the maturing tract appeared to be actively involved in myelination. That light oligoden-drocytes were more commonly seen ensheathing unmyelin-ated axons supports the notion that they are involved in the initiation of myelination. Dark oligodendrocytes must play an active role in myelination of the LCST, since our results indicate that they appear in large numbers after days, of period, population. oligodendro-percentage . . 20 few 4-week first the dark of the The the the initial decrease in light oligodendrocytes, but long be-fore myelination is completed in this tract. This observation differs from those in many rodent studies in which dark oligodendrocytes are observed in late stages of develop-ment, where they are responsible for maintenance of the myelin sheath Ling et al., 73 Immamoto et al., 78 Pater-son, %I , It may be that the dark oligodendrocytes observed in the LCST of the dog are different from those previously described in rats, or that the developmental time course for the maturation of oligodendroglia in the neonatal dog is different from that in rodents. Astroglial and microglial cell development Reports in the literature on the levels of astrocytic prolif-eration after birth vary somewhat, but in general astrocytic proliferation in the various regions of the forebrain cortex and corpus callosum and spinal cord is low Matthews and Duncan, 71 Gilmore, 71 Ling and Leblond, 73 Paterson et al., 73 Ling, 76 , whereas in the optic nerve it is high Vaughn, 69 Skoff et al., 76 Skoff and Sayre, 85 . In agreement with previous reports of astrocyte production in the spinal cord, we found this population to be relatively stable after birth. However, the small numbers of astro-blasts encountered in the LCST suggest a low level of postnatal astrocyte production. It seems that the astrocytic architecture is laid down earlier in the spinal cord than the optic nerve. This is consistent with the fact that large regions of the ventral and lateral funiculi in the spinal cord are well myelinated at birth i.e., well developed , particu-larly in the dog, whereas the optic nerve, which is less mature at birth, does not begin myelinating until several days after birth. Autoradiographic studies have shown that the prolifera-tive activity of microglia in different developing regions of the central nervous system is quite variable but generally quite low Ging and Leblond, 73 Ling, 76 Imrnamoto and Leblond, 78 Privat et al., 81 . Similarly, we found the microglial cell population to remain stable, and the average proportion to be about 7%. General implications ment, then different tracts would be affected at different times. Comparison of our results with those of canine mu-tants exhibiting abnormalities of myelination Griffiths et al., 81 Cummings et al., 86 may demonstrate fundamen-tal differences in the growth and differentiation of glia, which will help identify the stage at which this develop-mental process is affected.

On postnatal day P5, the percentage of labeled cells and the proportion of cells originating during 24-hr periods were quantified at four anteroposterior levels in the preoptic area. Throughout most of the preoptic area there is a lateral to medial neurogenetic gradient. Neurons originate between E12-El5 in the lateral preoptic area, between E13-El6 in the medial preoptic area, between E14-El7 in the medial preoptic nucleus, and between E15-El8 in the periventricular nucleus. These structures also have intrinsic dorsal to ventral neurogenetic gradients. There are two atypical structures 1 the sexually dimorphic nucleus originates exceptionally late E15-El9 and is located more lateral to the ventricle than older neurons 2 in the median preoptic nucleus, where older neurons E13-El4 are located closer to the third ventricle than younger neurons E14-El7 . For an autoradiographic study of morphogenesis, pregnant females were given a single injection of [3H] thymidine during gestation, and their em-bryos were removed either two hrs later short survival or in successive 24-hr periods sequential survival . Short-survival autoradiography was used to locate the putative neuroepithelial sources of preoptic nuclei, and sequential survival autoradiography was used to trace the migratory waves of young neurons and their final settling locations. The preoptic neuroepithelium is located anterior to and in the front wall of the optic recess. The neuroepithe-hum lining the third ventricle is postulated to contain a mosaic of spatiotem-porally defined neuroepithelial zones, each containing precursor cells for a specific structure. The neuroepithelial zones and the migratory waves origi-nating from them are illustrated. Throughout most of the preoptic area, neurons migrate predominantly laterally. The older neurons in the lateral preoptic area migrate earlier and settle adjacent to the telencephalon. Younger neurons migrate in successively later waves and accumulate medi-ally. The sexually dimorphic neurons are exceptional since they migrate past older cells to settle in the core of the medial preoptic nucleus. The median preoptic nucleus originates from a midline neuroepithelial zone that is continuous with the neuroepithelium in the midline basal telencephalon, and is, therefore, considered to represent a transitional area between the telencephalon and the diencephalon. There has been considerable interest recently in the preoptic area because of the growing evidence that it is critically involved in reproductive endocrine regulation Clemens et al., 76 Barry et al., 74 Witken et al., 82 Gibson et al., 841, the maintenance of male and female sexual behavior Lisk, 62, 67 Christensen and Clemens, 74 and maternal behavior Numan, 74 . However, the results of some physiological and behavioral studies have not supported this localization. For example, the presence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in cell bodies of the preoptic area has been questioned Baker et al., 75 Mer-chenthaler et al., 80 , and female sexual behavior has been reported to be unaffected by preoptic area lesions Law and Meagher, 58 Singer, 68 Powers and Valenstein, 72 . In addition, the role of the preoptic area in ovulation is contro-versial some studies indicate a major role Halasz, 69 Barraclough, 73 Gray et al., 78 Wiegand et al., 801, whereas another Clemens et al., 76 finds the critically important ovulatory control area in the anterior hypothal-amus. Support for the sexual function of the preoptic area has come from several anatomical studies that show sexual dimorphism in this region in rodents Raisman and Field, 73 Greenough et al., 77 Gorski et al., 79, 80 Andersen, 82 Hammer, 84 and humans Swaab and Fliers, 85 . But even this has been disputed since Bleier et al. 79, 82 localized the sexually dimorphic areas in the anterior hy-pothalamus rather than in the preoptic area. The preoptic area has been a source of controversy in the neuroanatomical literature as well. Krieg 32 states that it does not strictly belong to the hypothalamus. In fact, some of the components assigned to the preoptic area, such as the magnocellular preoptic nucleus Loo, 31 Humphrey, 36 and the preoptic continuation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis Gurdjian, 27 were recently shown to be part of the basal telencephalon Bayer, 79a,b, 85, 87 Altman and Bayer, 86 . On the other hand, many compo-nents assigned to the preoptic area have been described as anterior continuations of the hypothalamus Gurdjian, 27 Loo, 31 Krieg, 32 Humphrey, 36 Young, 361, or part of the anterior hypothalamus Bleier et al., 82 Bleier and Byne, 85 . In view of these controversies, it was felt that a detailed study of the development of the preoptic area may aid in a better understanding of its anatomical organization. Several morphogenetic studies have dealt with preoptic area development in relation to either the ontogeny of the diencephalon Rose, 42 Stroer, 56 Hyyppa, 69 Keyser, 79 or the entire basal forebrain Lammers et al., 80 . All of these studies agree that the preoptic area arises from the anterior third ventricle neuroepithelium. A few long-sur-viva1 [3Hlthymidine autoradiographic studies of neuron or-igin with the pulse-labeling technique have considered the preoptic area. Ifft 72 studied preoptic neurogenesis in connection with the hypothalamus Creps 74 described preoptic neurogenesis in connection with the septum, olfac-tory tubercle and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis Jacob-son and Gorski 81 described neurogenesis in the sexually dimorphic nucleus. In our study with the comprehensive labeling technique Altman and Bayer, 78a , the quantifi-cation of neurogenesis was limited to the posterior preoptic area since the focus was on hypothalamic neurogenesis. Our more recent study of embryonic and fetal hypotha-lamic development, using short-and sequential-survival autoradiography after pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine Altman and Bayer, 861, established that preoptic neurons originate from the neuroepithelium surrounding the preop-tic recess and anterodorsal wall of the optic recess of the third ventricle, whereas the anterior hypothalamus origi-nates from the neuroepithelium that extends from the pos-terodorsal wall of the optic recess to the infundibular recess. However, several nuclear components in the medial preop-tic area of adults could be delineated in fetal rats, and the relationship of the median preoptic nucleus the superior preoptic area was not resolved Altman and Bayer, 86 . The aim of this study is to provide a detailed study of the early developments of the entire preoptic area. The time-tables of neurogenesis within and between the major cell groups of the preoptic area are quantified by using long-survival, comprehensive [ Hlthymidine autoradiography. These analyses are correlated with an extensive study of the embryonic development of the preoptic area. By using short survival 2 hrs after a single injection of [3H]thymidine to delineate active neuroepithelial zones, an attempt will be made to identify the neuroepithelial sources of discrete preoptic structures. By using sequential survival one to several days after a pulse l3H]thymidine label, young neurons will be traced from the germinal zones to their final destinations. Finally, these observations will be related to both the functional and anatomical literature on the preoptic area. MATERIALS AND METHODS Long-survival [3H]thymidine autoradiography The experimental animals were the offspring of Purdue-Wistar timed-pregnant rats. The day the females were sperm positive was designated embryonic day one El . Normally, births occur on E23, which is also designated as postnatal day zero PO . Two or more pregnant females were given 2 subcutaneous injections of r3Hlthymidine Schwarz-Mann sp. act. 6.0 Ci mM 5 pcilg body wt to insure com-prehensive cell labeling. The injections given between 9 and 11 a.m. to an individual animal were separated by 24 hr. The onset of the [3H]thymidine injections was progres-sively delayed by 1 day between groups E13-El4, E14-E15,. . . E21-E22 . All animals were perfused through the heart with 10% neutral formalin on P5. The brains in the intact skulls were kept for 24 hr in Bouin s fixative, then were transferred to 10% neutral formalin. The heads were decalcified for 3 hrs in a chelating agent containing dilute HC1 Scientific Products #D1209-1 . At least 6 animals from each injection group including males and females were blocked coronally so that the entire diencephalon was kept in one piece. All blocks were embedded in paraffin. Every 15th section 6 pm through the preoptic area was saved. Slides were coated with Hodak NTB-3 emulsion, exposed for 12 weeks, developed in Kodak D-19, and poststained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were selected for quantitative analysis at 4 an-teroposterior levels see Figs. 2, 3 . Cells were counted mi-croscopically at X312.5 in unit areas set off by an ocular grid 0.085 mm . For quantification, all neurons within a designated area were assigned to one of two groups, labeled or unlabeled. Cells with silver grains overlying the nucleus in densities above background levels were considered la-beled obvious endothelial and glial cells were excluded. The proportion of labeled cells 7% labeled cells total cells was then calculated from these data. The determination of the proportion of cells arising ceas-ing to divide on a particular day utilized a modification of the progressively delayed comprehensive labeling proce-dure Bayer and Altman, 74 and is described in detail elsewhere Bayer and Altman, 87 . Briefly, a progressive drop in the proportion of labeled neurons from a maximal level 95% in a specific population indicates that the precursor cells are producing nonmitotic neurons. By ana-lyzing the rate of decline in labeled neurons, one can deter-mine the proportion of neurons originating over blocks of days or single days during development. As an illustration of the procedure, Table 1 shows the data and calculations for the ventral lateral preoptic area at levels 1 to 4. Throughout the quantitative analysis, it was noted that trends in cell labeling within animals were very consistent. However, variability between animals in an injection group were large enough to mask this trend. Therefore, cell label-ing patterns were analyzed with the sign test Conover, 71 , a nonparametric test designed for this type of data. The sign test determines the consistency of sequential neu- ron production between paired locations within individual animals. The comparisons are grouped into three cate-â+â gories 1 X Y, comparison 2 X Y, compar-â-â ison 3 X Y, â0â comparison. The zero comparisons are discarded and, depending on the total number of remaining + and ââ comparisons, either a binomial distribution or -â Short-and sequential-survival r3H]thymidine autoradiography The experimental animals were the embryos from Pur-due-Wistar timed-pregnant rats given a single subcuta-neous injection of [âHI thymidine Schwarz-Mann sp. act. 6.0 Ci mM 5 pCi g body wt between 9 and 11 a.m. The day of sperm positivity is designated as gestation embryonic day El. Several dams were injected for each day between El3 and E21. Survival times in each injection group varied from 2 hrs short-survival series to several days sequen-tial-survival series . For example, one dam in the El5 injec-tion group was sacrificed 2 hrs after the injection, another 1 day later on E16, another 2 days later on E17, and so on until the last dam was sacrificed on E22. All groups were treated as the El5 group. The dams were anesthetized with pentobarbital before the embryos were removed and sacri-ficed by immersion in Bouinâs fixative. After 24 hrs, the embryos were transferred to 10% neutral formalin until the time of embedding in either paraffin or methacrylate. The blocks were serially sectioned every 10th saved at 6 pm paraffin or at 3 pm methacrylate in the coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. For [âHlthymidine autoradiography, the slides were coated with Kodak NTB-3 emulsion, ex-posed for 6 weeks, developed in Kodak D-19, and post-stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS Neurogenetic gradients in long-survival autoradiograms Methodological considerations and anatomical rethe postnatal preoptic area differs from that reported in the embryonic study 1 the medial preoptic nucleus could be separated from the medial preoptic area, 2 the sexually dimorphic nucleus, not evident prenatally, was found at P5, and 3 because the pattern of cell origin in the intermediate preoptic area PIM is the same as in the ventral part of the anterior medial preoptic area PAM , the two were com-bined. In addition, the cell groupings in the superior preop-tic area were redefined in two ways 1 the median preoptic nucleus could be defined in the midline, and 2 the pattern of cell origin in the medial superior preoptic area PS was found to be the same as the dorsal part of the medial preoptic area PAM , and the two were combined. Neurogenesis was quantitatively assessed at four coronal levels from anterior Ll to posterior L4 L1-L2 represent the anterior preoptic area, L3-L4 the posterior preoptic area abbreviated as PA and PP, respectively . Figure 2A shows L1 in an animal exposed to [SHIthyrnidine on El5 and E16. Boundaries between the lateral and medial preop-tic areas are indicated by dashed lines. The subcommis-sural part of the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis BST henceforth referred to as the strial bed nucleus in-vaginates the dorsal portion of the lateral preoptic area. The ventral lateral septal nucleus VLS forms a roof over the lateral PAL and medial PAM preoptic areas. The boundary between the septum and preoptic area is easily distinguished in the El5 --El6 injection group, since the VLS contains more labeled cells than the dorsal parts of the preoptic area. Both the lateral and medial preoptic areas contain diffusely arranged neurons. The lateral preoptic area was divided into dorsal PALd and ventral PALv parts for quantification the medial preoptic area was divided in a similar fashion PAMd, PAMv . More defi-nite neuronal groupings at this level are the median preop tic nucleus MN in the midline above the lumen of the third ventricle and the medial preoptic nucleus MP . The median preoptic nucleus extends dorsally into the ventral part of the medial septal nucleus MS , and counts were made in dorsal MNd and ventral MNv parts. The medial preoptic nucleus is located adjacent to the third ventricle ependyma and contains more densely packed neurons than those in the surrounding medial preoptic area it was sub-divided into dorsolateral MPdl and ventromedial MPvm parts for quantification. At L2 Fig. 2B , the preoptic area contains the same structures that were represented at L1, but a few changes can be seen. The anterior strial bed nucleus is further shortening the dorsoventral extent of the lateral preoptic area. The anterior cornmissure AC cuts the median preop-tic nucleus into a dorsal part overlying the commissure and a ventral part extending to the dorsal tip of the third ventricle. The medial preoptic nucleus, still adjacent to the third ventricle ependyma, is larger and more prominent, At L3 Fig. 3A some notable changes take place in the preoptic area. The median preoptic nucleus is no longer present. The medial part of the posterior strial bed nucleus BSTm has completely cut off the dorsal part of the postero-lateral preoptic area therefore, only the ventral part PPLv was quantified. A triangular area, just medial to the BST in the dorsal preoptic area, was quantified as the lateral superior preoptic area PS1 . The medial preoptic area was quantified in dorsal PPMd and ventral PPMv parts. The medial preoptic nucleus contains a dense cluster of neurons in its core, the sexually dimorphic nucleus SDN . The ver-tical limb of the periventricular nucleus PVv lines the 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20EMBRYONIC DAY OF ORIGIN preoptic area P .0001 medial preoptic area neurons originate between El3 and E16. Neurons in the medial preoptic nucleus are generated mainly between E15-El7, significantly later P .0001 than most neurons in the medial preoptic area. the lateral preoptic area Fig. 5 in an animal exposed to L3H]thymidine on El4 and El5 shows that the proportion of labeled neurons increases from dorsal PALd, Fig. 5A to ventral PALv, Fig. 5C , indicating an intrinsic neuroge-netic gradient. The quantitative data show that throughout the lateral preoptic area, neurons are generated predomi-nantly on El2 through El4 Fig. 6 . The sign test indicated no significant differences along the rostrocaudal plane in the lateral preoptic area all P 0.05 and the graphs show combined data. The dorsal part contains 22% of its popula-tion originating on E12, and on the average, neurons here are generated significantly earlier than neurons in the ventral part P 0.0001 . At L3, a triangular shaped lateral superior preoptic area PS1, Fig. 3A lies medial to the posterior bed nucleus BSTm . Neurogenesis in PSI was compared to that in the dorsal medial preoptic area at L3 Fig. 7 . The lateral neu-rons originate predominantly on El3 and E14, earlier than those located medially P .0001 . The pattern of neuro-genesis is similar to that found in the ventral part of the lateral preoptic area bottom graph, Fig. 6 all P .05 , but it occurs significantly later P .0001 than neurogenesis in the dorsal part of the anterior lateral preoptic area top graph, Fig. 6 . The medial preoptic area. Autoradiograms of the medial preoptic area Fig. 8 in an animal exposed to [3H]thymidine on El5 and El6 show that the proportion of labeled neurons is lowest in the most posterior dorsal area Fig. 8A , inter-mediate in the anterior dorsal area Fig. 8B , and highest in the ventral area Fig. 8C . These trends indicate com-bined posterior older to anterior younger and dorsal older to ventral younger neurogenetic gradients. Within the dorsal part of the medial preoptic area, the sign test indicated simultaneous neurogenesis all P .05 at L1-L2 and at L3-L4. Consequently, Figure 9 shows combined data for anterior middle graph and posterior top graph levels. More than half 61% of the cells in the posterodorsal medial preoptic area originate on or before E14, whereas anterodorsal cells are evenly generated between El3 and El6 P .041 . The sign test indicated no significant differ-ences all P .05 between any parts of the ventral medial preoptic area along the rostrocaudal plane, and the bottom graph in Figure 9 combines data for all four levels. The neurons in the ventral population have a strong peak of neurogenesis on El5 44% originate in a single day , signif-icantly later than the dorsal cells P .OOOl. These three patterns of neurogenesis suggest that, rather than having a single population of neurons extending throughout the L3 out the medial preoptic nucleus at Ll-L3. This biphasic pattern suggests that two different neuronal populations are intermingled. The cells generated on El5 may be re-lated to the dorsolateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus since they are generated simultaneously. The cells gener-ated on El7 and El8 may belong to a âshellâ of neurons related to the sexually dimorphic nucleus. Possibly, these neurons are in a transition area extending to the anterior hypothalamus. The periventricular nucleus. The periventricular nucohorts of isochronic neurons 24 hrs old are adjacent to laterally placed unlabeled cells that were generated earlier. In much of the preoptic area, the lateral older to medial younger pattern of cell accumulation found at these early stages is retained as a neurogenetic gradient in adults. El4 to El5 series. Figure 13 is a series of sagittal sec-tions from an animal killed on E15, 24 hrs after exposure to a single I3H]thymidine injection on E14. In the midline Fig. 13D , the optic recess or separates the preoptic neu- roepithelium pn from the neuroepithelium ah that gen-erates the anterior hypothalamus AH . The preoptic neuroepithelium forms the anterodorsal wall of the optic recess and fuses with the midline septa1 neuroepithelium se in the region where the anterior commissure will decus-sate on E17. In more lateral sections Fig. 13A-C , the preoptic neuroepithelium retains its position as the antero-dorsal wall of the optic recess. A âwave frontâ of heavily labeled cells boung neurons generated on El41 is migrating away from the germinal matrix mPAL mPPL, Fig. 13A-B . These young neurons are destined for the lateral preop-tic area and will accumulate adjacent to older unlabeled neurons PALPPL, Fig. 13A . The floor of the telencephalon contains two ridges, an anterior ETA, located laterally in coronal sections and a posterior BTP, located medially in coronal sections . The foramen of Monro FM, Fig. 13B-C passes just behind the posteromedial basal telencephalic ridge and becomes continuous with the third ventricle vIII, Fig. 13B . Just lateral to the foramen of Monro, there is a deep cleft in the lateral ventricle, the medial horn mh, Fig. 13A . The data presented in a companion paper Bayer, â87 indicate that the neuroepithelium in the base of the cleft and along its lateral wall gives rise to the posterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis bstp, Fig. 13A , which extends into the preoptic area. Figure 14 shows coronal sections through anterior Fig. 14A , intermediate Fig. 14B , and posterior Fig. 14C parts of the preoptic area in an animal exposed to [3H]thymidine on El4 and sacrificed 24 hrs later E15 . The preoptic neu-roepithelium has a vertical limb the preoptic recess, pr and a horizontal limb the optic recess, or both limbs are active. This is to be expected since the neurogenetic data indicate that most of the neurons in the medial preoptic area and virtually all of the cells in the medial nuclei are still to be generated. Since the majority of the neurons in the lateral preoptic area have already been produced Figs. 4, 6 , the neuroepithelium found on El5 is not likely to contain many stem cells generating lateral preoptic neu-rons. The preoptic neuroepithelium has a thick core aster-isk, Fig. 14134 flanked by thinner dorsal and lateral parts. On the basis of the neurogenetic data, it is postulated that the thin dorsal flank is the neuroepithelial source triangle, Fig. 14B-C of the earlier generated dorsal medial preoptic area, whereas the somewhat thicker lateral flank is the source square, Fig. 14B-C of the later generated ventral medial preoptic area Fig. 9 . The thick core of germinal cells is presumed to be generating precursor cells that will later give rise to the medial preoptic and periventricular nuclei. Migrating heavily labeled neurons produced on El4 cell groups preceded with an âmâ in Fig. 14 are located just outside of the neuroepithelium. The neurogenetic data in-dicate that El4 is a peak day for neurogenesis in both dorsal and ventral parts of the lateral preoptic area Fig. 6 and dorsal parts of the medial preoptic area Fig. 9 . Conse-quently, the heavily labeled young neurons are postulated to be migrating into these areas. The most dorsal group of migrating neurons is presumably destined for the dorsal lateral preoptic area anteriorly mPALd, Fig. 14B and for the lateral superior preoptic area posteriorly mPSI, Fig. 140. The most ventral and lateral group of labeled cells is postulated to be young neurons migrating dorsally into the ventral lateral preoptic area mPALv mPPLv, Fig. 1413-C . The heavily labeled cells located just above the thick neu-roepithelial core are presumably neurons headed for dorsal NUCLEUS 4 300 13.14. 15 16 17 18 19 20afterhrsmm brain 0.25embryonic scaleEl6 hematoxylin, sectionedsections, sagittallyG-wm 13Figure E15.afterrnm brain 0.25embryonic scale6-wm 13Figure E16. parts of the medial preoptic area mPAMdmPPMd, Fig. 14B-C . The unlabeled neurons separated from the basal telencephalon BT in Fig. 14 by a dashed line extending to the ventral telodiencephalic fissure tdv, Fig. i4A are pre-sumed to be cells in the lateral preoptic area PAL and PPL that were generated on or before E13. El5 to El6 series. Figure 15 is a series of sagittal sec-tions from the brain of an animal sacrificed on E16,24 hrs after exposure to a single [3H]thymidine injection on E15. The first fibers of the optic chiasma OC lie in the midline Fig. 15C at the base of the anterior hypothalamus AH , and the optic tract runs along the floor of the diencephalon to posterior levels. The preoptic neuroepithelium pn has lengthened along the anteroposterior axis compared to its extent on El5 Fig. 13 . More laterally Fig. 15A-B , the optic recess or narrows to a horizontal slit in the anterior basal diencephalon. Unlabeled medial preoptic neurons PAWPM, Fig. 15A are located dorsal to the wave front of migrating labeled neurons mPAM mPPM, Fig. 15A-B generated on El5 and destined to reside in the ventral part of the medial preoptic area. The foramen of Monro FM and the medial horn of the lateral ventricle mh form the posterior boundaries of the posteromedial basal telence-phalic ridge BTP, Fig. 15A-B . The neuroepithelium at the base of the medial horn is actively generating neurons destined for the posterior strial bed nucleus bstp . The sagittal sections shown in Figure 15 do not extend to the lateral preoptic area. Figure 16 shows anteroposterior coronal sections through the preoptic area in an animal exposed to [3H]thymidâ ine on El5 and sacrificed on E16. The neuroepithelium lining the third ventricle still has thinner vertical pr and horizontal or limbs, flanking a prominent active core asterisk, Fig. 16B-C . The neurogenetic data indicate that the core neu-roepithelium is generating neurons for the ventromedial part of the medial preoptic nucleus Fig. 11 and the entire periventricular nucleus Fig. 12 since both of these struc-tures originate mainly on and after E16. The germinal cells along the ventral wall of the optic recess Fig. 16C are generating glial cells cgm for the optic chiasma OC and optic nerve. Heavily labeled migrating cells generated on El5 preceded with an âmâ in Fig. 16 are seen outside of the neuroepithelium. The neurogenetic data indicate ro-bust neuron production on El5 in the anterodorsal and ventral parts of the medial preoptic area Fig. 9 and dorso-lateral parts of the medial preoptic nucleus Fig. 11 conse-quently, the heavily labeled cells are presumed to be migrating into these structures. The dorsalmost group of migrating cells consists most likely of neurons heading for the dorsal medial preoptic area mPAMd, Fig. 16A-B those in the center are destined for the dorsolateral medial preop-tic nucleus mMPdl, Fig. 16A-B , and those ventrolaterallp for the ventral medial preoptic area mPAMv, Fig. 16A-B mPPMv, Fig. 16C . These neurons accumulate ventral and medial to older unlabeled neurons generated on or before El4 in the dorsal medial preoptic area PAMdPPMd , the lateral preoptic area PALPPL , and the lateral superior preoptic area PS1 . El6 to E17series. Sagittal sections from the forebrain of an animal exposed to 13H]thymidine on El6 and sacrificed one day later on El7 are shown in Figure 17. A large optic chiasma OC is seen just beneath the optic recess or near the midline Fig. 17B . The optic recess is less prominent laterally Fig. 17A than it was on El6 Fig. 15 . Migrating cells heavily labeled with an El6 injection mMP form a new âwave frontâ just outside of the preoptic neuroepithe-lium pn . The neurogenetic data indicate that most of these neurons will settle in medial nuclei Figs. 11, 12 . The un-labeled cells located above the migrating neurons were generated on or before El5 and have settled in the medial preoptic area PAMPPM . In the lateral section Fig. 17A , the posteromedial telencephalic ridge BTP is receding, the medial horn mh is more shallow, and the posterior strial bed nucleus neuroepithelium bstp is thinner since fewer neurons are being produced on day E17, Figure 18 shows coronal sections of the preoptic area in the brain of an animal exposed to [3H]thymidine on El6 and sacrificed 24 hrs later on E17. The preoptic recess pr is now more prominent than the optic recess a remnant is labeled âor,â Fig. 18B and the neuroepithelium has re-ceded toward the midline. The neuroepithelium is becom-ing exhausted in the dorsal parts of the preoptic recess, but remains thick and active ventrally and in the shortened horizontal limb. The neurogenetic data indicate that Ei7 is a prominent day for neurogenesis in the ventromedial part of the medial preoptic nucleus and the transition area Fig. 11 and throughout the periventricular nucleus Fig. 12 . Consequently, the persisting ventral neuroepithelium is postulated to be generating cells destined for these struc-tures. Heavily labeled neurons generated on El6 are mi-grating preceded with an âmâ in Figure 18 just outside of the neuroepithelium. The neurogenetic data indicate that El6 is a declining day for cell production in the medial preoptic area Fig. 9 and the dorsolateral medial preoptic nucleus top graph, Fig. 111, but a robust day for cell pro-duction in the ventromedial part of the medial preoptic nucleus Fig. 11 and in the vertical limb of the periventri-cular nucleus Fig. 12 . Therefore, the migrating cells are presumably destined for these structures. In anterior Fig. 18A and intermediate Fig. 18B levels, the most dorsome-dial migrating neurons mPAMd and the most ventrolat-era1 migrating neurons mPAMv may represent the few cells destined for the dorsal and ventral parts of the ante-rior medial preoptic area, whereas the majority of the mi-grating cells in the center mMPvm may settle in the medial preoptic nucleus, mainly in the ventromedial part. At the posterior level Fig. 18C , the most dorsomedial mPPMd and ventrolateral mPPMv migrating cells will presumably reside in the posterior medial preoptic area, whereas the smaller group of migrating cells in the center are headed for the periventricular nucleus mPV , mainly the vertical limb. The preoptic area on El7 has a prominent accumulation of unlabeled neurons throughout its entire rostrocaudal extent Fig. 18A-C . The older neurons in the lateral preop-tic area PALd, PALv, PPLv have been pushed farther from the ventricle as neurons accumulate in the medial preoptic area PAMd, PAMv, PPMd, PPMv . At anterior Fig. 18A and intermediate levels Fig. 18B , some of the unlabeled cells closest to the wave front of labeled migrating cells probably comprise the dorsolateral parts of the medial preoptic nucleus MPdl . The sexually dimorphic nucleus Neurogenetic gradients seen in long-survival autoradio-grams at P5. The autoradiograms in Figure 19 are of the sexually dimorphic nucleus SDN from a female Fig. 19A and male Fig. i9B exposed to r3H]thymidine on El7 and El8 and sacrificed on P5. The majority of the SDN neurons are labeled and stand out against the background of unla- beled cells in the dorsolateral medial preoptic nucleus, most of which have been generated by E17. Sexual dimorphism is already visible at P5 females tend to have a tighter cluster of neurons in SDN than males. Quantitative demonstration of the conspicuously late neurogenesis in SDN is shown in Figure 11. Neurogenesis begins on El5 and approximately 53% of the cells are gen-erated on or after E18, significantly later P .0001 than neurons in both parts of the medial preoptic nucleus. There is a âconcentricâ neurogenetic gradient within SDN The oldest neurons are present in an outer shell the youngest neurons are in the core. Some of the neurons that make up the shell of SDN may be present at L4 and may be partly responsible for the late wave of neurogenesis in the transi-tion area bottom graph, Fig. 11 . Since the injection groups contained both males and females, the data for each group were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test Siegel, â56 to see if there were any significant differences between the sexes. The results listed in Table 2 indicate that neuroge-nesis in the SDN is simultaneous for both males and females. In animals exposed to r3H]thymidine on El7 +E18, the medial part of the posterior stria1 bed nucleus BSTm is conspicuously labeled, and one can follow its extension into the posterior lateral preoptic area Fig. 20B where it ap-pears to continue into the SDN Fig. 20A . Since both SDN and BSTm contain late-forming neurons, neurogenesis was compared between the two nuclei Fig. 21 to see if there is a common germinal source. Similar to the neurogenetic gradients seen in the long survival autoradiograms at P60 companion paper, Bayer, â871, the peak time for neuroge-nesis is El4 in the lateral bed nucleus bottom graph, Fig. Zl , whereas most of the medial neurons are generated onE15-El7 middle graph, Fig. 21 P .OOOl . Neurogene-sis in the SDN is still high on El8 and E19, whereas it is declining in both parts of the BST P .0001, sign test . This difference in time of origin between the two nuclei is visible in animals that are exposed to [âHlthymldine on E19+E20 Fig. 22 . Only a few scattered neurons are la-beled in the medial BST, while many cells in the core of the SDN are heavily labeled. after this day Figs. 11, 21 . The only other preoptic area neurons labeled by this injection group are ventral and lateral cells in the periventricular nucleus Fig. 12 . The posterior preoptic neuroepithelium on El8 is active in the ventral part of the third ventricle. The neuroepithelium that presumably generates the SDN is indicated in Figure 23A. By E19, the lumen of the ventricle narrows consider-ably Fig. 23B , the neuroepithelium is being transformed into the primitive ependyma, and heavily labeled cells are seen just lateral to its borders. The heavily labeled cells migrate farther away from the ventricle on E20 Fig. 23C , and the ventricular lumen has become a narrow slit with a slight ventral dilation. On E21, some of the neurons arrive in the region where the SDN is presumed to be forming arrow, Fig. 23D . More neurons settle here on E22, and the cluster of heavily labeled cells is just beginning to take on the typical appearance of the SDN Fig. 23E . However, even at this late stage birth occurs on the next day , the nucleus is not distinct and can only be discerned with the aid of r3H1thymidine labeling in late injection groups. The median preoptic nucleus Neumgenetic gradients seen in long-survival autoradio-grams at P5. The El5 +El6 autoradiograms distinguish ventral and dorsal parts of the median preoptic nucleus Fig. 24 . At L1 Fig. 24B , few neurons are labeled in the ventral part, many are labeled in the dorsal part, and almost all are labeled above the anterior commissure at L2 Fig. 24A . The ventral older to dorsal younger neuroge-netic gradient in the median preoptic nucleus is one of the most pronounced gradients seen in the preoptic area. This gradient is atypical since, in contrast to the rest of the preoptic area, older neurons are located nearest to the ven-tricle, whereas younger neurons are further away. These gradients are quantified in Figure 25. The sign test indi-cated that the ventral parts of the nucleus originate simul-taneously all P .05 at Ll-L2 so these data are combined bottom graph, Fig. 25 . The ventral neurons originate early 72% on El3 and El41 significantly before P â0001 cells in the dorsal part of the nucleus. It is important to note that despite their midline location, the ventral neurons in the median preoptic nucleus originate simultaneously with many neurons in the lateral preoptic area all P .05 , and significantly earlier than neurons throughout the medial preoptic area and medial preoptic nucleus both compari-sons, P .0001 . Within the dorsal part, cells at L1 are generated with a peak on E15, whereas more neurogenesis occurs on and after El6 at L2 P .0001 . EMBRYONIC DAY OF ORIGIN Embryonic development seen in short and sequential au-torudiograms. The neuroepithelial source of the median preoptic nucleus is best seen in midline sagittal sections. The median preoptic neuroepithelium mn, Figs. 13D, 15C, 17B is continuous with the neuroepithelium se, Fig. 13D generating the medial septum SEm, Figs. 13D, 15C, 17B . Neurons heavily labeled with an El4 [3H]thymidine injec-tion are migrating away from this neuroepithelium on El5 Fig. 13D . At higher magnification not shown the labeled neurons accumulate among unlabeled cells that originated on E13 presumably, these are neurons in the ventral por-tion of the median preoptic nucleus MNv . On El6 Fig. 15C , there is an empty area possibly containing glial guid-ance channels Silver et al., â82 in the site where the anterior commissure [AC] will decussate. Ventral to the decussation, unlabeled older neurons have accumulated in the presumptive ventral median preoptic nucleus MNv . Cells heavily labeled by an El5 [3H]thymidine injection are migrating just in front of the decussation area and are presumed to be younger dorsal cells in the median preoptic nucleus MNd, Fig. 15C . A large collection of medial septa1 neurons SEm, Fig. 15C has settled just above the median preoptic nucleus. On E17, the medial sagittal section Fig. 17B is slightly lateral to the midline and grazes the lateral edge of the median preoptic nucleus cells heavily labeled on El6 MNd, Fig. 17B are still accumulating above and in front of the anterior commissure. The ventral to dorsal gradient can be clearly seen in serial coronal sections through the median preoptic nucleus primordium in an animal exposed to [3Hlthymidine on El6 and sacrificed on El7 Figs. 16, 26 . The unlabeled cells in the midline above the preoptic recess of the third ventricle Fig. 26A,B are destined to become ventral median preoptic neurons MNv . Extending dorsally from these unlabeled cells is a line of labeled neurons, presumably the future dorsal median preoptic nucleus MNd . The ventral part of the nucleus becomes small at the front edge of the decussa-tion of the anterior commissure Fig. 26C , and the heavily labeled cells in the midline above the commissure are being cut off from the ventral, subcommissural cells. Farther back in the commissural decussation Fig. 26D , heavily labeled cells generated on E16 are moving away from the neuroepithelium above the commissure mnj, which re-mains active, presumably producing the youngest median preoptic neurons in the dorsal posterior part of the nucleus. DISCUSSION Developmental patterns in the typical preoptic areas and nuclei The predominant neurogenetic gradients seen in the preoptic area are lateral older to medial younger and dorsal older to ventral younger , reflecting an âoutside-inâ pattern Angevine, â65 with respect to the neuroepithe-lium lining the third ventricle. The lateral to medial gradient is prominent and has been reported in all râHJthymidine autoradiographic studies of preoptic area development Ifft, â72 Creps, â74 Altman and Bayer, â78aj. The dorsal to ventral gradient was observed by Ifft â72 and Creps â74 in the periventricular nucleus and by Altman and Bayer â86 in the lateral preoptic area. Similar gra-dients are reported here in the medial preoptic area and the medial preoptic nucleus. Only the sexually dimorphic and median preoptic nuclei deviate from these gradients, and their atypical developmental patterns give clues to the unique nature of these two nuclei discussed in detail below . Armed with the comprehensive, quantitative picture of preoptic neurogenesis provided by the long-survival P5 au-toradiograms, the analysis of complex morphogenetic events can be âunraveled.â For example, active areas in the neu-roepithelium on specific embryonic days can be associated with the generation of adult populations having coinciden-tal peaks of neurogenesis. By timing r3H]thymidine injec-tions to heavily labeled cells generated on specific days, the sequential-survival autoradiograms Figs. 13-18,23 can be used to identify the consecutive waves of migrating neu-rons. Throughout this discussion, the hypothetical con-struct of a neuroepithelial zone is used, which is defined as a group of stem cells or cell line that produces neurons for a specific population Altman and Bayer, â80 Bayer and Altman, â87 . Our aim will be to show that the preoptic neuroepithelium contains a spatiotemporal âmosaicâ where the stem cells of specific populations are located in segre-gated or partially overlapping zones that become active in a precise temporal sequence. These relationships are dia-grammed in Figure 27, which correlates neuronal miya-tory waves with the position of putative preoptic neuroepi-thelial zones central drawing and the final settling places of neuronal populations throughout the anterior upper drawings and posterior lower drawings preoptic area. The first migratory wave consists of the oldest neurons generated E12-El4 in the lateral and superior preoptic ANTERIOR MIGRATORY ROUTESPOSTERIOR MIGRATORY ROUTES Krieg, 32 Humphrey, 36 Young, 36 Bleier and Byne, 85 . The second wave of migratory cells constitutes the medial preoptic area neurons generated E13-El6, medium stipple, Fig. 27 . On El5 Fig. 14 and El6 Fig. 16 , the preoptic neuroepithelium is still characterized by a thick core and thinner dorsal and lateral flanks, but it is confined to a more central core on El7 Fig. 18 . The flank areas are presumably generating the majority of medial preoptic neu-rons large arrows in wave 2, Fig. 27 since the disappear-ance of the flanks on El7 coincides with the decline of neurogenesis in the medial preoptic area Fig. 9 . Conse-quently, the neuroepithelial zones postulated to give rise to dorsal and ventral medial preoptic area neurons medium stipple in central drawing, Fig. 27 are located in the reced-ing dorsomedial and ventrolateral walls of the preoptic and optic recesses, respectively, between or partially overlap-ping with the neuroepithelial zones giving rise to the lat-eral preoptic area. Centrally placed germinal zones may also be the source of some medial preoptic area neurons YOUNG EST small arrows in wave 2, Fig. 27 , but the majority of the core stem cells are probably proliferating locally and will generate neurons for the third and fourth migratory waves. In the first two waves of cell migration, dorsomedial and ventrolateral zones are active concurrently. However, throughout the lateral and medial preoptic areas, there is a tendency for dorsal cells to be generated slightly earlier than ventral cells Figs. 6, 9 . This is postulated to be the result of a short lag in activity so that the ventrolateral zones generating the ventral parts of the medial and lateral preoptic areas begin to produce neurons slightly later and continue longer than their dorsomedial partners. In the anterior preoptic area, the third migratory wave is the last and consists of cells generated E14-El7, fine stip-ple, Fig. 27 that will settle densely in a structure variably named the medial preoptic nucleus Gurdjian, 27 Bleier and Byne, 851, the preoptic nucleus Krieg, 321, or the principal preoptic nucleus Loo, 31 Humphrey, 36 Young, 36 . On El5 Fig. 14B and El6 Fig. 16B , the most cen-trally placed neuroepithelium in the anterior preoptic area has a prominent evagination into the third ventricle, which declines by El7 Fig. 18B . The central evagination is the presumed source of the medial preoptic nucleus large ar-rows in anterior wave 3, Fig. 27 , since its dramatic reduc-tion by El7 coincides with the completion of neurogenesis in the dorsolateral part and the declining neurogenesis in the ventromedial part of the nucleus Fig. 11 . The neuroe-pithelial zone producing this third wave is postulated to be located within the zones generating the medial preoptic area lightest shading in central drawing, Fig. 27 . These neurons settle outside-in so that the oldest dorsolateral cells are farthest from the ventricle and the youngest ven-tromedial cells are adjacent to the ependyma. It is interest-ing to note that, correlated with early vs. late neurogenesis, there are neurochemical and neuroanatomical differences between dorsolateral and ventromedial parts of the medial preoptic nucleus. The older lateral part of the nucleus gets a more dense serotonin innervation than the younger me-dial part Simerly et al., 84 . Older lateral cells are more likely to contain vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, whereas younger medial cells are found with somatostatin, sub-stance P, and L-enkephalin Simerly et al., 86 . In the posterior preoptic area, the third and fourth migra-tory waves contain the young neurons that form a butter-fly -shaped extension in the medial preoptic area Fig. 1B . Humphrey 36 noted that the posterior medial principal preoptic nucleus was characterized by a concavity sur-rounding neurons similar to the interstitial cells in the lateral and medial preoptic areas no doubt this is the same structure we called the preoptic intermediate area PIM, Fig. 1B in fetal rats Altman and Bayer, 86 . The neuroe-pithelial zones generating the third and fourth waves are situated between the zones generating the medial preoptic area. The neuroepithelial zone generating the third wave fine stipple in central drawing, Fig. 27 is active between El4 and E17, producing neurons destined to settle in the medial preoptic nucleus, transition area, and the dorsal part of the vertical limb of the periventricular nucleus. The trajectory of the third wave neurons is predominantly dor-solateral and forms the upper wing of the butterfly pattern of younger neurons seen in fetal rats during early develop-ment Fig. 1B Altman and Bayer, 86 . The neuroepithelial zone generating the fourth wave clear area in central drawing, Fig. 27 is active between E16-El9 and produces the youngest neurons in the preoptic area. These cells will settle in ventral parts of the vertical limb and throughout the horizontal limb of the periventricular nucleus and in the sexually dimorphic nucleus discussed below . The tra-jectory of the periventxicular neurons in the fourth wave is predominantly radial as younger neurons stay close to the vertical and horizontal limbs of the third ventricle, under-cutting the older neurons in the ventral part of the medial preoptic area. These young neurons form the lower wing of the butterfly pattern seen in fetal rats Fig. 1B Altman and Bayer, 86 . The sexually dimorphic nucleus Neurogenesis in the sexually dimorphic nucleus is con-spicuously delayed, since it is the only structure in the preoptic area with substantial neurogenesis as late as El9 Figs. 11,22 . These data confirm the observations of Jacob-son and Gorski 81 that neurons in the rat sexually di-morphic nucleus could be heavily labeled up to El8 the last day for their [ HI thymidine injections . Late neuroge-nesis of sexually dimorphic neurons may be related to the recent findings that they receive a massive projection Sim- erly and Swanson, 86 from the youngest neurons in the encapsulated part of the strial bed nucleus Bayer, 87 . It is well documented that the posterior strial bed nucleus receives direct input from the accessory olfactory bulb White 65 Scalia and Winans, 75 Broadwell, 75 Skeen and Hall, 77 Davis et al., 78 . The vomeronasal epithe-lium and the accessory olfactory system are known to be crucial sensory inputs regulating sexual behavior Estes, 73 Whitten and Champlin, 73 Powers and Winans, 75 Winans and Powers, 77 . It is probable that there is only one synapse in the strial bed nucleus between the sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area and a sensory input relevant to sexual function. Since both the posterior strial bed nucleus and the sex-ually dimorphic nuclei contain conspicuously late originat-ing neurons, we entertained the hypothesis that the youngest neurons in both nuclei have a common origin. This hypothesis was rejected when a comparison between times of neurogenesis in the two nuclei Fig. 21 showed that the youngest bed nucleus neurons originate earlier than many of the sexually dimorphic neurons, and no cells could be traced migrating into the sexually dimorphic nu-cleus from the neighborhood of the posterior strial bed nucleus. Instead, we found that a cluster of heavily labeled late-generated cells actively migrate away from a neuroe-pithelial zone in the third ventricular preoptic neuroepithe-lium past older cells in the periventricular and medial preoptic nuclei to settle in a dorsolateral position Fig. 23 . Creps 74 noted that part of the medial preoptic nucleus in the mouse showed an inside-out neurogenetic gradient with respect to the periventricular nucleus possibly that observation is related to the late neurogenesis of the sex-ually dimorphic nucleus. We could not confirm Jacobson and Gorski s 81 obser-vation that the sexually dimorphic nucleus originates ear-lier in females than in males. In our material, there were no statistically significant differences between the sexes Table 2 . Jacobson and Gorski 81 allowed their animals to survive into the juvenile period, whereas our animals survived only until P5. The discrepancy between these two observations might be resolved if the late-produced neurons selectively die in females after P5. Several lines of experi-mental evidence show that dimorphism occurs perinatally and postnatally rather than prenatally. Neither Hyyppa 69 nor Jacobson et al. 80 saw any sexual dimorphism in preoptic area development prenatally, during the time when all sexually dimorphic neurons are generated. However, Jacobson et al. 80 found sexual differences as early as postnatal day one, and we found them to be obvious in our P5 series of long-survival autoradiograms. Exposing fe-males to androgens during early postnatal development can abolish the female pattern and establish the male pattern of synaptic terminations from the stria terminalis and other sources in the lateral preoptic area Field and Sher-lock, 75 . Gibson et al. 84 found that preoptic area tissut-from fetal male donors transplanted into the preoptic areas of female mice with a genetic hypogonadal disorder was just as effective in restoring fertility as was tissue from female donor fetuses. Thus, sexual dimorphism between males and females may depend more on epigenetic factors the differential endocrine environment in early life than on neurogenetic differences between the sexes. The median preoptic nucleus Neurogenesis in the median preoptic nucleus is unique for two reasons 1 in spite of its location in the midline, where younger preoptic area neurons are found, neuroge- nesis is simultaneous with older lateral peroptic area neu-rons, and 2 it is the only structure in the preoptic area where the oldest neurons settle closest to the third ventricle and the youngest neurons are located farther away. The ventral to dorsal neurogenetic gradient was illustrated in our earlier neurogenetic study of the hypothalamus Alt-man and Bayer, %a . This gradient also correlates with differences in anatomical projections to the preoptic area and hypothalamus. The dorsal part of the median preoptic nucleus projects to the lateral preoptic area, the intermedi-ate part projects to the supraoptic nucleus, and the ventral part projects to the arcuate and medial ventromedial hypo-thalamic nuclei Swanson, â76 . With these unique neurogenetic features, it is not surpris-ing that the neuroepithelial zone generating the median preoptic nucleus lies outside of the third ventricle as it is seen in coronal sections Figs. 14,16,18 . In midline sagittal sections Figs. 13D, 15C, 17B , the median preoptic neuro-epithelium is continuous with the midline basal telence-phalic neuroepitheliurn. The apical surfaces of the median preoptic neuroepithelial cells are facing dorsally, toward the foramen of Monro and the midline basal telencephalon Figs. 14B, 16B, 26D . Germinal zones in the rest of the preoptic area either face medially toward the preoptic re-cess or ventrally toward the optic recess and neuronal migration is lateral and dorsal. In agreement with the findings of our earlier study on hypothalamic morphogene-sis Altman and Bayer, â78b , neurons migrate radially from the median preoptic neuroepithelium so that the oldest cells lie in front and above the most rostra1 extent of the preoptic recess. Younger cells pile up dorsal to the older cells, closer to the germinal source, and around the anterior commissure. The descriptive anatomical literature on the preoptic area regards the median preoptic nucleus as continuous with the periventricular nucleus Loo, â31 Humphrey, â36 Young, â36 Bleier et al., â82 Bleier and Byne, â85 , and an older dorsal to younger ventral neurogenetic gradient found in the preoptic periventricular region is presumed to be devel-opmental evidence of continuity between the two nuclei Ifft, â72 Creps, â74 . Neither the developmental patterns reported here nor the adult morphology support these ob-servations 1 the periventricular nucleus is generated by a neuroepithelial zone lining the walls of the preoptic and optic recesses and has no structural continuity with the zone generating the median preoptic nucleus, 2 the neu-rogenetic gradients within the two nuclei are divergent rather than continuous-ventral older to dorsal younger in the median preoptic dorsal older to ventral kounger in the periventricular. Finally, 3 we could not see evidence of structural continuity between the median preoptic and periventricular nuclei in our material. The median preoptic nucleus is only found anteriorly Fig. 2 , where the periven-tricular nucleus is absent. The question remains as to whether or not the median preoptic nucleus should still be considered part of the preop-tic area since it does not come from the third ventricle. Indeed, we speculated that it was telencephalic in our ear-lier study of hypothalamic neurogenesis Altman and Bayer, â78a . However, that classification also has its problems especially when one considers the placement of the anterior commissural decussation. The anterior commissure is be-lieved to cross the midline at the interface between the telencephalon and diencephalon Altman and Bayer, â78a,b . If that is true, then the part of the nucleus below the commissure is âdiencephalic,â whereas the part of the nu-cleus above the commissure is âtelencephalic.â Apparently, the median preoptic neuroepithelium is truly transitional and serves as a bridge between the telencephalon and diencephalon.

J. Comp. Neurol. 378 159â172, 1997. r 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The entire length of the embryonic neural tube is composed of undifferentiated pseudostratified neuroepithe-lium. At specified positions along the longitudinal axis, there are constrictions in the wall of the neural tube, which forms vesicles that correspond to the principal structures of the central nervous system CNS spinal cord, hindbrain rhombencephalon , midbrain mesen-cephalon , and forebrain prosencephalon . From these vesicles develop the neuromeres that are particularly visible in the hindbrain. Each of these ontogenic units is characterized by the expression of regulatory genes, such as those encoding the transcription factors Krox-20 Chavrier et al., 1988 Wilkinson et al., 1989a , Hox Murphy et al., 1989 Wilkinson et al., 1989b Frohman et al., 1990 Sundin and Eichele, 1990 Hunt et al., 1991 , and Pax Krauss et al., 1991a,b Gruss and Walther, 1992 Walther and Gruss, 1991 , and intercellular signalling molecules, such as growth factors Wilkinson et al., 1988 Wilkinson, 1990 , membrane-bound receptor tyrosine- kinases Gilardi-Hebenstreit et al., 1992 Nieto et al., 1992 Becker et al., 1994 , and retinoic acid-binding pro-teins and receptors Maden et al., 1992 Zimmer and Zimmer, 1992 . The expression of these genes may regu-late regional specification, differentiation, proliferation, and other processes within the segments Wilkinson et al., 1989b Graham et al., 1989 . Neural tube segmentation is not restricted to the hind-brain, however. Recent studies, have shown that candidate regulatory genes, in mouse and chicken embryos, such as Dlx-1, Dlx-2, Wnt-3, Gbx-2, Nkx-2.2, and sonic hedgehog sonic hh are also segmentally expressed in the forebrain Bulfone et al., 1993 Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993 Ruben-stein et al., 1994 Price et al., 1992 Echelard et al., 1993 , and morphogenic experiments Martinez et al., 1991 Figdor and Stern, 1993 Alvarado-Mallart, 1993 Marin and Puelles, 1995 , confirm this organisation. It was, therefore, proposed that the forebrain is subdivided into six transverse domains called prosomeres p . The three most caudal prosomeres, p1 to p3, form the diencephalon, whereas p4 to p6 form the secondary prosencephalon Bulfone et al., 1993 Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993 Ruben-stein et al., 1994 . In each prosomere of the forebrain, there are also longitudinally ordered domains which paral-lel the longitudinal axis of the neural tube, and correspond to the roof, alar, basal, and floor plate of the spinal cord Bulfone et al., 1993 Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993 Ruben-stein et al., 1994 Shimamura et al., 1995 . Most of the genes implicated in regulating various aspects of early forebrain patterning and differentiation encode transcription factors. However, membrane local-ized proteins N-CAM and peanut-agglutinin receptor or acetylcholinesterase are also expressed within domains consistent with a neuromeric organization of the forebrain Figdor and Stern, 1993 . In the CNS, dm-20, an alterna-tive spliced product of the plp gene, is present, between embryonic day E 9.5 and E12.5, in the basal plate of p1 to p4 Timsit et al., 1992, 1995 . Later in development, both DM-20 and its isoform proteolipid protein PLP are ex-pressed by oligodendrocytes, and are major components of CNS myelin. The DM-20 PLP proteins have four putative transmembrane domains, are involved in the compaction of CNS myelin and are absent from the peripheral nervous system PNS myelin. One of the major constituents of PNS myelin is PMP-22 peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa, a product of the PMP-22 gene . By analogy, as PMP-22 has also four putative transmembrane domains, it may fulfill, in the PNS myelin, similar structural functions to DM-20 PLP in the compaction of CNS myelin. In the adult PNS, PMP-22 is synthesized by Schwann cells and is expressed throughout the compact myelin sheath Spreyer et al., 1991 Snipes et al., 1992 Kuhn et al., 1993 . PMP-22 transcripts have also been detected, however, in adult brain, although at much lower levels than in the PNS Spreyer et al., 1991 Welcher et al., 1991 Bosse et al., 1994 . In a recent study, we have shown that, in the CNS of 3-week-old mouse and rat, PMP-22 mRNA and protein are selectively expressed by motoneurons of the spinal cord ventral horn and in neurons of all the cranial nerve motor nuclei, except for the abducens Parmantier et al., 1995 . PMP-22 transcripts were also detected by Northern blot and RT-PCR at E12.5 in the developing brain Bosse et al., 1994 . The expression of PMP-22 transcript was analysed in the CNS during embryonic development. Here we report that PMP-22displayedabiphasicspatio-temporalpatternofexpres- sion. From E11.5 to E17.5, PMP-22 mRNA was expressed in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord, rhombencephalon, mesencephalon,andprosencephalonwithamarkedventrodor-sal differential expression observed in each segmental area. The second phase of PMP-22 expression started by E18.5 in motoneurons forming the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, and postnatally in the spinal cord motoneurons. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Embryos from OF1 mice Oncin France line 1, IFFA-CREDO, LâArbresle, France were taken at embryonic days E E9.5, E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, E15.5, E17.5, E18.5, E19.5, and postnatal P animals at P1 and P2, where P1 is the day of birth. The average gestation period lasted 20.5 days. The midpoint of the dark interval during which mating occured was designated as day 0 and the embryos were considered to be E0.5 on the morning following mating. For each age analyzed, at least three different embryos were examined and the same pattern of localization observed. Animals were anaesthetized with Vetranquil 0.5% 2.5 ml kg, ip., Sanofi, Toulouse, France followed by Imalgene 1000 2.5 ml kg, ip., Rhone-Merieux, Lyon, France . In situ hybridization Embryos were fixed at 4Â°C by overnight immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 PBS 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl . From E17.5 onwards, embryos were perfused intracardi-ally with the same solution. Brain and spinal cord were carefully dissected and immersed in the same fixative for an additional 12 hours at 4Â°C. After fixation, tissues were dehydrated and paraffin-embedded Paraplast Plus . Se-rial sections 7.5 Î¼m were collected on gelatin chrom-alum-coated glass slides and stored at 4Â°C until hybridization. Hybridization with [35S]-UTP radiolabeled probes and posthybridization treatments were carried out as previ-ously described Timsit et al., 1992 . Radio-and digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes A radiolabeled antisense mouse cRNA probe was gener-ated in the presence of a-[35S]-UTP 1,000 Ci mmol Amer-sham, les Ulis, France with T3 RNApolymerase Pharma-cia LKB Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden , from the T3 promoter of a Bluescript plasmid containing the full length mouse PMP-22 gas3 cDNA gift of Dr. L. Philipson cut at the single Not I site, by using a Riboprobe kit Promega Corp. Madison, WI . The control sense cRNA probe was synthe-tised from the T7 promoter of the same plasmid cut at the Xho I site. Specific activities of both probes were in the range of 1â1.5 107 cpm Î¼g of RNA. Before hybridization, probes were hydrolyzed for 55 minutes in 0.4 M Na2CO3 at 60Â°C to generate fragments of about 150 bases. Digoxi-genin-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes were generated by using the same procedure, except that the nucleotide mixture contained 0.33 mM UTP and 0.17 mM digoxigenin-UTP Boehringer Mannheim, Germany . In situ hybridization and immunolabeling on whole-mount embryos Hybridization on whole-mount embryos between E10.5 and E12.5 was performed as described in Bally-Cuif et al. 1992 . Briefly, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformalde-hyde in PBS for 4 hours at room temperature and, from E10.5 onwards, the neural tube was dissected from the embryos, fixed for an additional 1â2 hours in the same fixative, and then gradually dehydrated in methanol PBT PBS 0.1% Tween 20 up to 100% methanol, and stored at 220Â°C until use.All the other treatments including hybrid-ization and detection of the hybridized probe with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline-phosphatase-labeled antibody, were as in Bally-Cuif et al. 1992 . For immunolabeling after development of the alkaline phosphatase activity, embryos were dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in polyester wax Merck, Darmstadt, Germany . Sections 7 Î¼m were collected on poly-L-lysine Sigma, St. Louis, MO and gelatin Sigma coated slides. Sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C in TuJ1 antibody diluted 1 200 in PBS containing 0.25% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate Tween-20, Sigma and 0.5% sheep serum. TuJ1 a gift of Dr.A. Frankfurter is a monoclonal antibody raised against the neuron-specific type III b-tubulin Moody et al., 1987 and has been shown to label specifically neuronal cell bodies and processes Easter et al., 1993 Lubetzki et al., 1993 . After extensive washes, bound antibody was de-tected by using a biotinylated sheep anti-mouse Ig anti-body Amersham and the Vectastain ABC system Vector, Burlingame, CA . The peroxidase activity was revealed by using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride Sigma and hydrogen peroxide Merck . DISCUSSION Specificity of the PMP-22 probe In the rat and the mouse, two different PMP-22 cDNAs, SR13 and CD25, have been isolated Welcher et al., 1991 Spreyer et al., 1991, Parmantier et al., 1995 . The SR13 and CD25 mRNA species are each approximately 1.8 kb in size Boose et al., 1994 . The nucleotide sequences of these two transcripts have identical coding and 38 untranslated regions, but differ in the 58-untranslated region, which represents less than 10% of the total sequence Spreyer et al., 1991 Welcher et al., 1991, Parmantier et al., 1995 . In the present study, we used the gas3 PMP-22 probe, which encodes the mouse equivalent of SR13. The corresponding cRNA derived probe should thus hybridize as well with both SR13 and CD25 transcripts. Both transcripts are present in the PNS, but the levels of CD25 are about seven-fold higher than those of SR13 Bosse et al., 1994 . In the adult CNS, we previously reported that, with the exception of the brain stem and spinal cord where both transcripts are present, only the SR13 mRNA is found in other brain areas Parmantier et al., 1995 . During embry-onic CNS development, a RT-PCR study using RNA ex-tracted from total brain has shown that SR13 is already expressed at E12, while CD25 is not detectable before E15 Bosse et al., 1994 . Here, using in situ hybridization we report a biphasic spatio-temporal expression of PMP-22. Given the difference in sensitivity of PCR and in situ hybridization, it can be proposed that the PMP-22 signal detected in the ventricular zone between E11.5 and E17.5 would correspond to the SR13 message, while the motoneu-rone signal first detected at E18.5, would result from the additional expression of the CD25 transcript. Alterna-tively, it is possible that the PMP-22 cRNA probe might hybridize with other closely related genes. Indeed, it has been reported that PCR performed using a sequence tagged site for PMP-22, has detected in human DNA a second unexpected fragment, in addition to the predicted PMP-22 amplification product. However, this additional fragment was not detected in mouse DNA. Furthermore, although hybridization of the PMP-22 probe to another family member gene cannot be excluded, due to the high stringency conditions used for the in situ hybridization experiments, this possibility is very unlikely. During embryonic development of the CNS, PMP-22 expression in the mouse follows a double spatio-temporal pattern. Starting at E11.5, PMP-22 is expressed in neuro-epithelial cells in several longitudinal domains along the caudorostral axis of the neural tube. At E17.5, a PMP-22 signal was no longer detectable from the neuroepithelium and the adult pattern of expression in motoneurons of the cranial nerves motor nuclei and of the spinal cord appears. This second and final wave of PMP-22 expression begins at E18.5 and follows a rostro-caudal gradient. There are several reasons why PMP-22 expression in motoneurons is not related to its earlier segmental expres-sion in neuroepithelial cells of the ventricular zone. In the rhombencephalon, the PMP-221 ventromedial column is localized in the r5 and r6 basal plate. Although r5 and r6 produce facial and glossopharyngeal motoneurons, respec-tively Lumsden and Keynes, 1989 Fritzsch et al., 1993 Gilland and Baker, 1993 Marin and Puelles, 1995 , which express PMP-22 in the adult, they also produce the VI cranial nerve Lumsden and Keynes, 1989 , which does not express PMP-22 at any time Parmantier et al., 1995 . PMP-22 expression is therefore not specific to the branchio-motor column anlagen. Furthermore, we never observed the migration of PMP-221 cells from the neuroepithelium to the final locations of motoneurons in the mantle layer. In the spinal cord, the caudal extension of the PMP-221 ventrolateral column corresponds to the domain of expres-sion of the Pax-6 genes Walther and Gruss, 1991 , which are thought to specify the neuroepithelial cells that will produce motoneurons. However, the Pax-6 gene is ex-pressed earlier than PMP-22 and motoneurons are already present at E15.5âE16.5, at least 5 days before PMP-22 is detected in them. For these three reasons, induction of PMP-22 expression in motoneurons is probably indepen-dent of earlier induction of the gene in the neural tube. This has been observed for other genes, for example fushi tarazu, which is expressed in a seven striped pattern at the blastoderm stage of Drosophila development, then tran- siently in a specific subset of neuronal precursor cells, neurons, and glia in the developing CNS Doe et al., 1988 . Function of PMP-22 during CNS development Does PMP-22 functions as a growth arrest specific gene? Although PMP-22 has been characterized as a Schwann cell marker and a constituant of peripheral myelin, it is not myelin specific. Indeed, the cDNA encod-ing PMP-22 was first isolated from NIH3T3 fibroblasts as the growth arrest specific mRNA 3 gas-3 and its expres-sion has been shown to be negatively correlated with fibroblast growth in culture Schneider et al., 1988 Manfio-letti et al., 1990 . PMP-22 has been, recently implicated in the phenotypes of two allelic PNS dysmyelinating muta-tions in mice, trembler and tremblerj Suter et al., 1992a,b . In humans, the PMP-22 gene has been associated with the majority of familial and spontaneous cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A CMT1A disease, the most frequent hereditary peripheral neuropathy Lupski et al., 1991, Raeymaekers et al., 1991 Patel et al., 1992 Timmerman et al., 1992 Matsunami et al., 1992 Valentijn et al., 1992 Wise et al., 1993 . Both trembler and CMT1Aare character-ized by severe myelin deficiences and an excessive prolifera-tion of Schwann cells. These observations and the identity between PMP-22 and gas3 led different groups to hypoth-esise that PMP-22 may function as a growth arrest specific gene Suter et al., 1993 Suter et al., 1994 Bosse et al., 1994 Zoidl et al., 1995 . The present study of PMP-22 expression during CNS development in the mouse, do not support this hypothesis. Indeed, the first wave of expres-sion, between E11.5 and E17.5, occurs in the ventricular neuroepithelium which is composed of undifferentiated proliferative cells. At E18.5, PMP-22 is expressed in moto-neurons of the cranial nerve motor nuclei, and at P1 of the spinal cord, which is several days after motoneurons have dropped out from the cell cycle Altman and Bayer, 1980 . PMP-22 as a marker of position In the mesencephalon and prosencephalon. The neuroepithelial domains that express PMP-22 represent a longi-tudinal column that ends at the boundary between p4 and p5. This column follows the longitudinal brain axis, dorsal to the basal plate alar plate boundary sulcus limitans . The latter limit, which is not morphologically apparent in the prosencephalon, was recently revealed by several molecular markers. The Nkx-2.2 gene is expressed at this longitudinal boundary all along the mesencephalic and prosencephalic neuroepithelium, and Sonic hh has been identified in the mesencephalic and prosencephalic basal plate, thus, defining the ventral boundary of this region Rubenstein et al., 1994 Shimamura et al., 1995 . The transcript for PMP-22 is not detectable in the neuroepithelial cells of the zona limitans, although the p2 neuroepithelium contiguous to the zona limitans ex-presses PMP-22 in a dorsal expansion that apparently follows the caudal zone of Nkx-2.2 expression Rubenstein et al., 1994 Shimamura et al., 1995 . The expression of PMP-22 in p3 starts at some distance from the more rostral p2 domain of expression. The gap between the two regions of expression is thicker ventrally than dorsally, consistent with the previously defined shape of the zona limitans Puelles et al., 1987 Rubenstein et al., 1994 . The patterns of PMP-22 expression are different in the alar domains of the prosomeres. The level of expression is similar in mesencephalon and p1, p2, and p4, but de- creases in p3, and is not detectable in p5âp6. The p2 p3, p3 p4, and p4 p5 boundaries are therefore clearly delim-ited by the contrasts in signal intensity Rubenstein et al., 1994 . These segmental differences are probably related to the combination of regulatory genes expressed in the different prosomeres Bulfone et al., 1993 Puelles et al., 1987 Rubenstein et al., 1994 or with the schedule of development specific to each segment Keyser, 1972 Puelles et al., 1987 Altman and Bayer, 1979a,b,c . The segmental pattern of PMP-22 expression in the prosencephalon Fig. 8 is consistent with a recently proposed prosomeric model Bulfone et al., 1993 Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993 Ruben-stein et al., 1994 . In the rhombencephalon. The orthogonal columnar and segmental pattern of PMP-22 in the rhombencephalic neuroepithelium, which is schematically represented in Figure 8, partially recapitulates the transverse segments and longitudinal columns that have been described as fundamental to the morphogenesis of this structure Vaage, 1969 Kessel and Gruss, 1990 Wilkinson and Krumlauf, 1990 Lumsden, 1990 Martinez et al., 1992 Tan and Le Douarin, 1991 Gillan and Baker, 1993 Glover 1993 Marin and Puelles, 1995 . The alar column of expression between r2 and r7 could be morphologically related to the vestibular column, which has recently been demonstrated in the alar plate of rhombomeres r2 to r7 Marin and Puelles, 1995 . The particularly high level of PMP-22 expression in the r4 alar plate, could be related to the neuroepithelial anlage of the ventral nucleus of Deiters which develops exclusively in r4 Glover, 1993, 1994 Marin and Puelles, 1995 . Areas of the rhombencephalon that clearly do not ex-press PMP-22 are the dorsal regions containing the anlage of the cochlear nuclei and the rhombic lip structures and a ventral column, corresponding to the somato visceral sen-sory column Hugosson, 1957 Marin and Puelles, 1995 , between the PMP-221 alar and basal plate columns. strate that, between E11.5 and E17.5, PMP-22 expression clearly defines longitudinal columnar and transverse segmental domains in the rhombencephalon, mesen-cephalon, and prosencephalon. The sharp limits of PMP-22 expression domains suggest that PMP-22 expressing cells may provide positional information to the adjacent cells or growing axon pathways. No correlation could be estab-lished, however, between the expression of PMP-22 in the neuromeres and the determination of their segmental identity. Indeed, rhombomeres are transitory structures which can be clearly observed, in the mouse CNS, between E8.5 and E10.5, and the constrictions at the boundaries between prosomeres in the forebrain appear at E10.5, whereas PMP-22 expression begins at E11.5. However, transcription factors either involved in the specification of the rhombomeres, such as members of the Hox B cluster Krumlauf, 1993 , Gbx-2, and Pax 6 Walther and Gruss, 1991 Gruss and Walther, 1992 Bulfone et al., 1993 , or expressed in the diencephalon, such as Nkx-2.2, Dlx-2, and Sonic hh Price, 1993 Bulfone et al., 1993 Echelard et al., 1993 Rubenstein et al., 1994 have been shown to be expressed in the same domains as PMP-22, or adjacent areas, but earlier. In this respect, expression of PMP-22 in the neuroepithelium occurs too late during embryogenesis to suggest any role in specification of territories. We propose that transcription of PMP-22 may be controlled or induced by a combination of these regulatory genes. In the adult CNS, expression of PMP-22 in motoneuron axons which are myelinated by PMP-221 Schwann cells, led us to propose that, due to its membrane localization, PMP-22 may play a role in the interactions between motor axons and their ensheathing Schwann cells Parmantier et al., 1995 . Similarly, we can postulate that the PMP-221 ventricular cells are tightly adhesive. It has been proposed that cells from different territories do not mix during embryonic development Figdor and Stern, 1993 Fraser et al., 1990 Birgbauer and Fraser, 1994 . Territorial specifi-cation can be achieved either by the formation of bound-aries between neuromeres or by the expression of specific adhesion molecules at the surface of cells within each territory. PMP-22, transiently expressed at the surface of ventricular neuroepithelial cells in defined territories, may be one of these adhesion factors. RESULTS PMP-22 transcripts were first detected at E11.5 in the CNS and in various mesodermal derivatives, such as 1 the cartilage of the first branchial arch mandibular and maxillary processes , the larynx and the vertebrae, and 2 some muscles of the tongue Figs. 1, 6 . Only PMP-22 expression in the CNS has been analysed in detail. No signal was detected on control sections hybridized with the sense cRNA probe. PATTERN OF PMP-22 EXPRESSION AT E11.5â12.5 The anatomic subdivisions are derived from Bulfone et al. 1993 and Shimamura et al. 1995 . In the prosencephalon In the prosencephalon, the detection of PMP-22 signal was restricted to a longitudinal domain which extended from the mesencephalic prosencephalic boundary, into pro-someres 1 to 4 p1âp4 . The ventral and dorsal limits of PMP-22 expression were clearly evident Fig. 1b . In prosomeres 1 to 4, PMP-22 was never detected in the ventral area of the basal plate. In p1 and p2 pretectal region and dorsal thalamus, respectively PMP-22 was expressed in a continuous longi-tudinal domain that followed the basal alar boundary. Ventrally, PMP-22 transcripts were observed close to the limit between the basal and alar plates, whereas dorsally PMP-22 was no more detectable at some distance from the roof plate Figs. 1aâ3 3bâe . No PMP-22 signal was Figure observed in the most dorsal domain of the alar plates Figs. 1a,b,d,e 3bâe . In p2, the PMP-22 signal expanded dor-sally along the p2 p3 interprosomeric boundary, contacting the zona limitans cells, which were PMP-22 negative Figs. 1d,e . In p3 ventral thalamus , the ventro-dorsal limits of PMP-22 expression were the same as in p1 and p2, but the signal was weaker than in p2 and p4 Figs. 1a,d,e 2a 3f . The difference in the level of expression of PMP-22 in p3 and p4 nucleus of stria medullaris anlage and eminentia thalami clearly defined the p3 p4 boundary. This limit lies between the reticular thalamic nucleus p3 and the anla-gen of the nucleus and tract of the stria medullaris p4 . Dorsally, in p4, the longitudinal domain of PMP-22 expres-sion included the eminentia thalami, but never reached the caudal ganglionic eminence Figs. 1d,e 2b . Rostrally, detection of PMP-22 signal stopped at the p4 p5 boundary, i.e., between the p4 derived structures tract and nucleus of stria medullaris and the anlagen of the stria terminalis nucleus complex and the paraventricular nucleus, running from dorsal to ventral in the p5 alar plate Figs. 1a,c,d 2a,b . PMP-22 transcripts were not detected in the two most rostral prosomeres p5âp6 , comprising the chiasmatic, preoptic, anterior hypothalamic, and entopeduncular ar-eas Figs. 1d,f 2a,b . In the telencephalon, a faint PMP-22 signal was detected in the neuroepithelium of the olfactory bulb Fig. 1d . In the mesencephalon A PMP-22 signal was observed in the ventricular zone of the mesencephalon.As illustrated in Figure 3b, expression appeared homogeneous at the transition between the mesencephalon and diencephalon. No clear limit between the mesencephalon and the most caudal prosomere p1 could be detected Fig. 3b . The mesencephalic signal was restricted to the ventral region of the alar plate, bounded ventrally by the sulcus limitans. No signal was detected in the mesencephalic basal plate nor in the dorsal alar zones Figs. 1d,e 3c . Caudally, the longitudinal domain of detection of PMP-22 signal stopped abruptly at the limit between the mesencephalon and the isthmus. The fossa isthmica appeared as a PMP-22 negative transverse band between PMP-22 expressing territories in the mesencepha-lon and rhombencephalon Figs. 1bâe 4a,c . In the rhombencephalon and spinal cord Whole-mount hybridization performed on dissected E12.5 brain and spinal cord, revealed both columnar longitudi-nal and segmental transverse patterns of expression in the rhombencephalon Fig. 4a,b . This was confirmed on paraffin embedded transverse sections Fig. 4c,d . The floor plate and the paramedial regions of the rhomben- cephalon and spinal cord did not express PMP-22 Fig. 4a,b . In the rhombencephalon, two columns were identi-fied in the basal plate and one in the dorsal plate Fig. 4a,b . The two rhombencephalic basal plate columns were designated ventromedial and ventrolateral, according to their position relative to the floor plate. The ventromedial column was observed in the basal plate of rhombomeres 5 and 6 r5âr6 . This column ex-tended between the r4 r5 and r6 r7 boundaries, with a weak extension caudal to r6 r7. The ventrolateral column was more intensely labeled, and extended along the caudo-rostral axis from r8 to the r3 r4 boundary. Caudally, the expression in r8 continued along the basal plate of the spinal cord. The dorsal boundary of the ventrolateral column coincided with the sulcus limitans Fig. 4a,d . Between the ventromedial and ventrolateral columns, at the level of r5 and r6, a narrow band of cells weakly expressed PMP-22. This signal extended rostrally in r4 and caudally in r7 Fig. 4a,b . The PMP-22 signal in the basal plate columns was homogeneous. No interruptions or decreases in expression were observed at the interrhom-bomeric boundaries. In the rhombencephalic alar plate, a third column of cells extending from the r7 r8 to the r1 r2 boundaries expressed PMP-22 at levels that differ from those of the rhombomeres Fig. 4b . A higher level of expression was observed in r4 in which PMP-22 expression extended ventrally and connected the alar and the basal columns. Rostrally, in the r3 and r2 alar plates the PMP-22 signal was less intense. Caudally, depending on the level of PMP-22 expression, the alar column between r5 and r7 presented a stronger signal in its ventral portion Fig. 4b . Along the alar column, the changes in PMP-22 signal intensity at the rhombomeric edges, delimited the inter-rhombomeric boundaries. In addition, PMP-22 was also expressed in the r1 alar plate, ventral to the cerebellar anlage, with an increasing rostro-caudal gradient Fig. 4aâc . To determine whether PMP-22 expressing cells were neurons, double labeling was performed with a digoxigenin-labeled PMP-22 antisense cRNA probe and the TuJ1 antibody, which is specific for neuronal class III b-tubulin. As illustrated in Figure 5, the PMP-22 signal was re-stricted to the ventricular layer of the rhombencephalon, and no co-expression of TuJ1 and PMP-22 was detectable. PMP-22 mRNA expression in the CNS between E12.5 and 17.5 In later stages of development, expression of the PMP-22 mRNA decreased gradually. As shown on Figure 6, at E14.5, PMP-22 was expressed in the same domains as at E12.5, with the addition of one new territory the ventricu-lar epithelium of the lateral ganglionic eminence, where PMP-22 was restricted to the ventricular ganglionic cortical angle Fig. 6a . Since the thickness of the ventricu-lar epithelium decreases during development, the PMP-22 positive domain was reduced to a thin layer of cells Fig. 6a,b . At E15.5, the PMP-22 signal in the ventricular zone continued to decrease and had totally disappeared by PMP-22 mRNA expression between E18.5 and P1 At E18.5, motoneurons of the trigeminal V, not shown , facial VII , glossopharyneal XI , and hypoglossal XII nerves Fig. 7a,b were PMP-221. Between E19.5 Fig. 7câe and postnatal day 2 Fig. 7g,h , both the number of positive cells and the intensity of the signal increased in these locations. In the spinal cord, the motoneuronal expression of PMP-22 was delayed by 2â3 days. At E19.5, while Schwann cells in the ventral and dorsal roots, and in the dorsal root ganglia, were clearly PMP-221, no signal was visible in the spinal cord Fig. 7f . At birth, motoneu-rons in the cervical spinal cord started to express PMP-22 Fig. 7h . At postnatal day 2, the latest stage analysed, no PMP-22 signal was observed in the oculomotor nuclei of nerves III, IV, and VI, although in the adult, a faint PMP-22 signal was detectable, in the motor nuclei of nerves III and IV Parmantier et al., 1995 .

Comp. Neurol. 416 269â275, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. In the central nervous system CNS , nitric oxide NO is synthesized by neurons and acts, physiologically, as a neuromodulator Dawson et al., 1994 . Nitric oxide, re-leased at a nerve terminal, has a limited diffusion path but can stimulate postjunctional events in neighboring neu-rons. Nitric oxide is short-lived but highly reactive at heme moieties on proteins, such as the soluble form of guanylate cyclase Dawson and Snyder, 1994 . Stimulation of guanyl-ate cyclase by NO causes increased formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate GMP that, through cyclic GMP-gated ion channels, alters intracellular calcium lev-els, thus modulating neural activity de Vente et al., 1998 . Receptors for neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, can also be modulated directly by NO Lipton et al., 1993 . Nitric oxide is synthesized when needed from l-arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase NOS . There are three isoforms of NOS that are expressed from three different genes. In the neurons of the CNS, the predomi-nant, constitutive isoform, which is physiologically rel-evant, is neuronal NOS NOS-1 . A variety of genetic and posttranscriptional mechanisms produce subtypes of the NOS-1 isoform that may have different activities in differ-ent cell types Wang et al., 1999 . By using immunohisto-chemistry, NOS-1 has been localized in the human CNS to specific neurons in the nonpyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex, pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells of the hippocam-pus, aspiny neurons of the corpus striatum, basket, Pur- kinje and granule cells in the cerebellum, and neurons of various brain stem nuclei Egberongbe et al., 1994 .Awide distribution of NOS-1 in the rat brain has also been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry Rodrigo et al., 1994 . NOS-1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum within the cell body, where it is synthesized, and to the nerve terminals, where it acts to form NO. NOS-1 turns over constantly in nerve cells and, therefore, the level of this isoform depends on the presence of its messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA . By using in situ hybridization for mRNA for NOS-1, the synthesis of this isoform has been localized to the cell bodies of specific neurons Norris et al., 1995 . Numerous publications in the literature have presented evidence that NO is a neuromodulator in the retinas of fish, frogs, salamanders, rats, and humans Goldstein et al., 1996 . By administration of exogenous NO donor molecules or inhibitors of NOS and measurement of subse-quent neural activity, NO appears to modulate the activity of photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, and reti-nal ganglion cells. Studies of homogenates of bovine Geyer et al., 1997 and human Park et al., 1994 retinas indicate that neuronal NOS is expressed in retinal cells. Several attempts have been made to localize the cellular source of the NO by using histochemical techniques to localize NOS. A common technique stains for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH diaphorase activity as a marker for NOS activity Bredt et al., 1991 , and this technique has been used on retinal tissue Vaney and Young, 1988 Sagar, 1990 Koistinaho et al., 1993 Osborne et al., 1993 Huxlin and Bennett, 1995 Roufail et al., 1995 Roufail and Rees, 1997 . However, the specificity of this marker is not optimal, and NADPH diaphorase activity does not distinguish the different isoforms of NOS. Specific antibodies to the NOS isoforms have been used to demonstrate the cellular localization of NOS-1 in the rat and rabbit retinas. These studies have reported NOS-1 localization to amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer, displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer, retinal ganglion cells, nerve fibers in the outer plexiform layer and inner plexiform layer, and the inner segments of both rod and cone photoreceptors Perez et al., 1995 Roufail et al., 1995 Goldstein et al., 1996 Lopez-Costa et al., 1997 Patel et al., 1997 Haverkamp and Eldred, 1998 . The rat retina is often used as a model for studying phenomena that are believed to be important in the human retina, e.g., photoreceptor degenerations, neural circuitry, ischemic injury, and optic nerve damage leading to retinal ganglion cell degeneration. Considering that previous studies cited above may have contained some nonspecific findings and that NOS-1 localization to the retinal ganglion cells has been somewhat controversial, we have used both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybrid-ization to localize precisely the cells in the rat retina that contain NOS-1. For the human retina, tissue homogenates have been demonstrated to contain constitutive NOS activity Park et al., 1994 and NADPH diaphorase histochemistry Chen et al., 1998 has demonstrated presumed NOS activity in retinal layers. Cellular localization of the neuronal isoform in the human retina has focused on amacrine cells Roufail et al., 1995 , but there has been no cellular localization of NOS-1 to the several layers of the human retina. Whether there is analogy in cellular localization of NOS-1 in the human and rat retina is not clear. Because of the presumed importance of NO as a neuromodulator in neural circuits in the retina, the possible contribution of NO to neurode-generation in the retina and the use, in humans, of drugs that can alter the NO-cyclic GMP pathway, we have used both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to demonstrate the neural cells in the human retina that constitutively contain NOS-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rat and human tissue Albino Wistar male rats, 2â3 months in age 200â300 g , were killed by intraperitoneal injection of 0.15â0.20 ml of a cocktail consisting of 1.5 ml xylazine 100 mg ml and 10 ml ketamine 100 mg ml . At killing, animals were per-fused intracardiacally with isotonic saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4. Enucleation of both eyes was performed with a suture placed at the 12 oâclock position for proper orientation, and eyes were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour. Subsequently, the cornea, iris, and lens were removed. The posterior segment was dissected free of surrounding tis-sues, fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehde for 1 hour, and then transferred to 70% ethanol overnight. Fixed tissue was washed in 0.2% glycine in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and oriented for 6-Î¼m sagittal sections. In several animals, unilateral optic nerve transection, sparing the vascula-ture, was performed as described Solomon et al., 1996 4 weeks before killing. All experiments were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and all methods adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. Human eyes were obtained through eye banks from normal donors. The eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sent to our laboratory within 24 hours after death of the donor. The posterior segments were dissected free of surrounding tissues, washed in 0.2% glycine in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and oriented for 6-Î¼m sagittal sections. Immunohistochemistry The NOS-1 isoform was identified by using a polyclonal antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA to human NOS-1, which recognizes an epitope at the amino terminus working dilution 1 300 . After deparaf-finization and rehydration, slides were preincubated with 5% skim milk for 30 minutes and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Primary antibody was localized by immunoperoxidase staining with commercial reagents Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA . The biotinylated secondary antibody was incubated on the sections for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, and reacted with the streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate for 30 minutes. After a wash, sections were incubated with one drop of the substrate mixture 1.5 mg of 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahy-drochloride and 50 Î¼l of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.6 . The sections were reacted until brown staining appeared, approximately 1â3 minutes, washed in PBS, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehy-drated, and covered with a cover slip Cytoseal 60 Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA . Representative sections of all samples were stained simultaneously to control variation in the reactions. Con-trols were performed by eliminating primary antibody from the incubation medium or by replacing the primary antibody with nonimmune serum followed by immunoper-oxidase staining. Slides were examined in a microscope BH2 Olympus, Tokyo, Japan , and images were recorded by digital photomicrography Spot Diagnostic Instru-ments, Sterling Heights, MI and stored as a computer file Adobe Photoshop Adobe, San Jose, CA . In situ hybridization Specific complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cDNA probes for human and rat NOS-1, subcloned in transcrip-tion vector pGEM-7Z, were obtained from Dr. Mark Currie Searle Monsanto, St. Louis, MO . Plasmid cDNA was prepared as a ââmidi-prepââ according to an established protocol Promega, Madison, WI . Restriction enzyme analysis was performed to confirm that the plasmids contained the desired inserts. Linearized cDNAs were transcribed in vitro with incorporation of digoxigenin to generate sense and antisense complementary RNA cRNA probes by using a kit and following the manufacturerâs instructions Genius 4 kit Boehringer-Mannheim, India-napolis, IN . Sections were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde pH 7.2 for 10 minutes, rinsed in PBS, and then treated with 0.3% Triton-X in PBS for 15 minutes, 5 Î¼g ml proteinase K for 30 minutes at 37Â°C, and 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 5 minutes. After a rinse in PBS, slides were fixed as above for 5 minutes on ice and rinsed again in PBS. Next, sections were incubated in 0.1 M triethanolamine TEA buffer pH 8 for 3 minutes, shaken in 0.25% acetic anhydride in TEA for 10 minutes and washed twice in 23 saline-sodium citrate SSC for 5 minutes. Hybridization was performed at approximately 100 ng probe section. Sense and antisense probes were heated at 70Â°C for 5 minutes before application to the sections. Sections were covered with 50 Î¼l hybridization buffer 50% deionized formamide, 8% dextran, 13 Denhardt solution, 53 SSC, 0.5 mg ml yeast transfer RNA [tRNA], pH 7.5 containing sense or antisense probe and incubated over-night at 42Â°C. Posthybridization, sections were washed in 23 SSC for 15 minutes at 45Â°C, treated with 20 Î¼g ml RNase A in hybridization buffer at 37Â°C for 30 minutes, and washed in decreasing SSC 23â0.13 . Hybridized probe was visualized by washing sections in Tris buffer 1 100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 , blocking with Tris buffer 1 containing 0.1% Triton-X and 2% calf serum for 30 minutes, and incubating with anti-digoxigen-alkaline phosphatase conjugate DIG-AP at 37Â°C for 1 hour in a humid chamber. Sections were washed several times in Tris buffer 1 and then washed twice in Tris buffer 2 100 mM Tris-base, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mM levamisole, pH 9.5 . Color was developed in 60 ml Tris buffer 2 containing 1.2 ml nitroblue tetrazolium chloride 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate NBT BCIP stock solution. Representative sections of all samples were stained simultaneously to control variation in the reactions. Con-trols were performed by eliminating the cRNA probe from the hybridization buffer or by replacing the antisense probe with sense probe. Slides were examined in a micro-scope, and images were recorded as above. DISCUSSION Our results clearly demonstrate the localization of NOS-1 to the photoreceptors of the rat retina. Earlier reports failed to comment on a photoreceptor localization for NOS Vaney and Young, 1988 Sagar, 1990 Dawson et al., 1991 Yamamoto et al., 1993 , although inspection of one of the figures Dawson et al., 1991 indicates its presence in inner segments in the rat retina. More recently, NOS-1 has been localized to the outer segments Roufail et al., 1995 and the synaptic regions Haverkamp and Eldred, 1998 of the rod photoreceptors of the rat retina. In the rabbit retina, NADPH diaphorase histochemistry Osborne et al., 1993 and immunohistochemistry Koch et al., 1994 demon-strated heavy NOS activity in inner segments of rod and cone photoreceptors and a lighter staining of cone outer segments. By using in situ hybridization, we have local-ized the mRNAfor NOS-1 to the inner segments of both rod and cone photoreceptors in the rat and human retina. The inner segments are presumably the site of synthesis of the NOS-1 protein. Note that the NOS-1 protein localizes to the outer segments of cones in the human retina, but not to the outer segments of rods, to the inner segments, and to the terminals of the photoreceptors. Nitric oxide, presum-ably synthesized by the constitutive NOS-1 in photorecep-tors, may stimulate the soluble guanylate cyclase found in photoreceptors Koch et al., 1994 , causing increases in the cyclic GMP-gated conductances Schmidt et al., 1992 Kurenni et al., 1995 and modifying events in the visual transduction pathway. In the terminals of the photorecep-tors, nitric oxide, synthesized by NOS-1 may contribute to neuromodulation Koch et al., 1994 by increasing transmit-ter release Savchenko et al., 1997 . Several subpopulations of amacrine cells contain neuro-nal NOS, depending on the species. In the rabbit retina, NADPH diaphorase histochemistry has demonstrated two types of amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer contain-ing NOS Vaney and Young, 1988 Sagar, 1990 Bredt et al., 1991 Osborne et al., 1993 . NOS is present in type I amacrine cells, which are large cells on the inner margin of the inner nuclear layer, and in type II amacrine cells, which are smaller and more numerous Chun et al., 1999 . Localization of NOS in the rat retina demonstrated, in one report Dawson et al., 1991 , consistent results and, in another report Yamamoto et al., 1993 , inconsistent re-sults comparing NADPH diaphorase staining with immu-nohistochemistry using an antibody to neuronal NOS. Nevertheless, there appears to be good agreement in the literature for NOS-1-positive cells in the inner margin of the inner nuclear layer of the rat as a limited population of amacrine cells, presumably type I Yamamoto et al., 1993 Huxlin and Bennett, 1995 Roufail et al., 1995 Patel et al., 1997 . Our results with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization confirm the presence of abundant NOS-1 in a subpopulation of amacrine cells of the rat retina. In the human retina, NAPDH diaphorase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry have localized NOS activity to amacrine cells Roufail et al., 1995 Roufail and Rees, 1997 . Our results demonstrate that at least one type of presumed amacrine cells, perhaps type I in the inner margin of the inner nuclear layer in the human retina, expresses a markedly high level of NOS-1. The ganglion cell layer of the retina contains retinal ganglion cells, which send their axons centrally to form the nerve fiber layer and optic nerve. Depending on the species, the ganglion cell layer also contains varying numbers of displaced amacrine cells. In the human, there are relatively few displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer whereas in the rat, approximately half of the cells in this layer are displaced amacrine cells. There have been several reports on NOS-1 activity in the ganglion cell layer of the rat, but the cell type has not been consistently identified. NOS immunoreactivity has been associated with the following 1 occasional retinal gan-glion cells Dawson et al., 1991 2 a modest number of scattered cells of the same size as the presumed type I amacrine cells and with processes to the inner plexiform layer, which are interpreted to indicate displaced amacrine cells Yamamoto et al., 1993 and 3 increased expression in retinal ganglion cells after pterygopalatine parasympa-thetic denervation Yamamoto et al., 1993a . In our study of the rat retina using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we observe staining with both techniques associated with large cell somas containing a large nucleus with an easily identifiable nucleolus, which are characteristic of retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, 4 weeks after optic nerve transection, which causes retro-grade degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, these large NOS-1-containing cells are not present. We interpret our results to indicate that retinal ganglion cells in the rat retina contain NOS-1. In the human retina, both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry clearly demon-strate NOS-1 associated with the large somas that are characteristic of retinal ganglion cells and in the axons of the retinal ganglion cells in the nerve fiber layer. Thus, NOS-1 in retinal ganglion cells may have, within the retina, a postjunctional function in the dendrites and somas of the retinal ganglion cells and, centrally, a neuro-modulator function at the nerve terminals of the retinal ganglion cells in the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus. By using the techniques of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we conclude that the localizations of NOS-1 to photoreceptors, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells are similar in the rat retina and in the human retina. RESULTS Rat retina In the rat eye, in situ hybridization, using a specific cRNA probe to detect the mRNA, and immunohistochemi-cal staining, with a specific polyclonal antibody to detect the protein, clearly demonstrates the presence of NOS-1 in cells in several layers of the retina. In Figure 1A, in situ hybridization indicates two intensely stained layers of the outer retina that are positive for NOS-1 mRNA. Localiza-tion is to the inner segments of the photoreceptors and to the terminal regions of the photoreceptors in the outer plexiform layer. In Figure 1B, immunohistochemistry dem-onstrates the same distribution in the photoreceptors for NOS-1 protein as for the mRNA. The inner segments are intensely labeled for NOS-1 protein, as are the terminal regions of the photoreceptors in the outer plexiform layer. The NOS-1 protein is not present in the outer segments of the photoreceptors. Localization of NOS-1 is apparent in the rods, which are much more numerous than cones in the rat retina, and is similar in central, middle, and peripheral regions of the rat retina. When viewing a full-thickness retina at low power, the most intense staining for NOS-1 mRNAis in the inner segments of the photoreceptors data not shown . In Figure 1C, in situ hybridization demonstrates that NOS-1 mRNA is present in many cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer and, as visualized by the relatively more intense staining, is present in increased amounts in large cell bodies proximal to the inner plexiform layer. Similarly located cells can be identified by immunohistochemical staining as containing NOS-1 protein. Both the cell soma and processes extending into the inner plexiform layer are positive for NOS-1 protein Fig. 1D . In the retinas of rat eyes with optic nerve transection, which causes degenera-tion of retinal ganglion cells see below , immunohisto-chemical staining for NOS-1 of the cells in the inner nuclear layer was still present. In the ganglion cell layer, cells with large somas are positive for NOS-1 mRNA by in situ hybridization Fig. 1E . As a control, in situ hybridization with a sense probe for NOS-1 demonstrates no specific labeling of the gan-glion cell layer Fig. 1G . Similar to the localization of its mRNA, NOS-1 protein is localized to most cells with large somas and some cells with smaller somas in the ganglion cell layer by immunohistochemistry Fig. 1F . Most, but not all, cells in the ganglion cell layer of the rat retina had positive labeling for NOS-1 mRNA and protein. In the rat retina, approximately half of the cells in the ganglion cell layer are retinal ganglion cells, and half are displaced amacrine cells. In the retinas of eyes with optic nerve transection, which causes retrograde degeneration of reti-nal ganglion cells, there was a loss of the large cell somas and the associated loss of immunohistochemical staining for NOS-1 in the large cell somas of the ganglion cell layer Fig. 1H . After optic nerve transection, some small somas in the ganglion cell layer stained positive for NOS-1 protein. Presumably, these are displaced amacrine cells. Human retina In the human eye, in situ hybridization, using a specific cRNA probe to detect the mRNA, and immunohistochemi-cal staining, with a specific polyclonal antibody to detect the protein, clearly demonstrate the presence of NOS-1 in cells in several layers of the retina. In Figure 2A, in situ hybridization demonstrates that the mRNA for NOS-1 is present in the cytoplasm of the inner segments of both the rod and cone photoreceptors. In the outer nuclear layer, paranuclear staining for NOS-1 mRNAis apparent around the nuclei of cones. Notably, NOS-1 mRNAis also apparent in the outer segments of cones. Figure 2B demonstrates by immunohistochemistry the localization of the NOS-1 pro-tein in the outer retina. Similar to its mRNA, NOS-1 protein is abundantly present in cone inner segments and outer segments. The rod inner segments contain traces of NOS-1 protein, but the rod outer segments do not contain NOS-1 protein. NOS-1 protein is also apparent in the terminals of the photoreceptors in the outer plexiform layer. Staining is similar in central, middle, and peripheral regions of the human retina. In Figure 2C, in situ hybridization of mRNAfor NOS-1 is present in most cells in the inner nuclear layer, and staining is most intense in large cell bodies that are occasionally found proximal to the inner plexiform layer. By changing the focus, these cells can often be seen sending their processes into the inner plexiform layer data not shown . Similarly appearing cells can be identi-fied as containing NOS-1 protein Fig. 2D . In the ganglion cell layer of the human retina, most of the cells are retinal ganglion cells, and relatively few are displaced amacrine cells. In the ganglion cell layer, cells with large somas are positive for NOS-1 mRNA by in situ hybridization Fig. 2E . Similarly, these presumed retinal ganglion cells are positive for NOS-1 protein in the soma by immunohistochemistry Fig. 2F . NOS-1 protein is also apparent in the axons of the retinal ganglion cells in the nerve fiber layer. Controls Control slides for in situ hybridization using NOS-1 sense cRNA probes were all negative for specific staining for rat retina Fig. 1G and for human retina Fig. 2G . Control slides for immunohistochemistry in which the primary antibody was omitted or replaced with nonim-mune serum were all negative for specific staining for rat retinas data not shown and for human retinas Fig. 2H .

Parasol cells are one of the major types of primate retinal ganglion cells Polyak, 1941 . They are also called M cells because they project to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus LGN Leventhal et al., 1981 Perry et al., 1984 . Using intracellular recording and dye injection, Dacey and Lee 1994 showed that parasol cells with dendrites ramifying in the outer half of the inner plexiform layer IPL give OFF responses to light, and parasol cells with dendrites ramifying in the inner half of the IPL give ON responses to light. Peripheral parasol cells receive 20% of their input from bipolar cells, but it is uncertain which types of bipolar cells these are Jacoby et al., 1996 . The goal of this study was to identify the presynaptic bipolar cells. Three types of bipolar cells have axon terminals that might provide input to parasol cell dendrites DB2 and DB3 diffuse cone bipolar cells and flat midget bipolar cells FMB Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 . From electron micro-scopic serial reconstruction studies, midget bipolar cells in the human and macaque parafovea were known to provide input to a single midget ganglion cell and not to other ganglion cells Kolb and Dekorver, 1991 Calkins et al., 1994 . However, it was uncertain whether midget bipolar cells contact other types of ganglion cells in the peripheral retina. To determine which bipolar cells were likely to provide input to peripheral OFF parasol cells, the appositions between intracellularly injected parasol cells and bipolar cells labeled by immunofluorescence were studied by using a confocal microscope. Type DB2 bipolar cells were labeled with antibodies to human excitatory amino acid trans-porter 2 hEAAT2 , and DB3 cells were labeled with anti-calbindin CaBP Martin and Gru Â¨nert, 1992 . FMB cells were labeled with anti-recoverin Milam et al., 1993 Wiechmann and Hammarback, 1993 Gru Â¨nert et al., 1994 Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1994 . Immunofluorescence results sug-gested that DB3 axon terminals made extensive apposi-tions with OFF parasol cells. A double-label electron microscopic EM experiment showed unequivocally that DB3 bipolar cells were presynaptic to OFF parasol gan-glion cells. DB2 bipolar cells appeared to make appositions with OFF parasol cells, but FMB cells axons did not make any more appositions with OFF parasol cells than would be expected due to chance. MATERIALS AND METHODS Macaque Macaca mulatta eyes were enucleated within 10 minutes after the animal had been overdosed with sodium pentobarbital 50â100 mg kg IV by other investi-gators at the conclusion of experiments that did not involve the eyes. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee. The eyes were transported to the laboratory in glass jars packed in ice for 15 minutes and then hemisected. They were put into oxygenated Ames medium Sigma, St. Louis, MO at room temperature, and the vitreous humor was removed with fine forceps. The procedure for intracellular injection was the same as described previously Jacoby et al., 1996 . Briefly, the retinas were treated with acridine orange 4 minutes, 10 Î¼M , mounted ganglion cell side up on a fixed-stage, upright microscope, and continuously superfused with Ames medium containing 95% oxygen 5% carbon dioxide. Microelectrodes made from thin-walled borosilicate glass 50â100 MV were filled with 2.5% Lucifer yellow Molecu-lar Probes, Eugene, OR and 5% Neurobiotin Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA in 20 mM 3-[N-morpho-lino] propanesulfonic acid MOPS Sigma , pH 7.6. Large ganglion cell somata were injected first with LuciferYellow using negative current pulses 2 Hz, 5â10 nA until they were confirmed to be parasol cells, and then they were filled with Neurobiotin by switching the polarity of the injecting current to positive for 3â6 minutes. After a patch of parasol cells had been successfully injected, the tissue was fixed for either light or electron microscopy. Light microscopy Tissue for light microscopy was fixed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The injected cells were visualized by incubating the tissue for 1â2 days in 1 200 indocarbocyanine Cy3 -streptavidin Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA in phosphate-buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4, with 0.3% Triton X-100. After all the stained cells were verified as parasol cells, the retinas were either processed for immu-nofluorescence as flat mounts or sectioned at 90 Î¼m with a tissue chopper Brinkmann, Westbury, NY . The tissue was incubated from 5 to 14 days in primary antisera diluted in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide PBSA and 0.3% Triton X-100. Monoclonal antibodies to the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28k Sigma , rabbit anti-recoverin Wiechmann, 1996 Yan and Wiechmann, 1997 , and rabbit anti-human excitatory amino acid trans-porter-2 hEAAT2 Arriza et al., 1994 were used at 1 1,000. Secondary antibodies made in goat or donkey and conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC or indodicarbocyanine Cy5 Jackson Immunoresearch Labo-ratories were used at a dilution of 1 100 in PBSA for 2 days. For the triple-labeling experiment, the primary antibodies recoverin, hEAAT2, and calbindin were ap-plied separately, each followed by the appropriate fluoro-phore-conjugated secondary antibody Cy3, Cy5, and FITC . Rabbit anti-recoverin was applied first followed by Cy3-donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin IgG. After the tissues were rinsed for 2 days to remove as much unbound antibody as possible, rabbit anti-hEAAT2 was applied followed by Cy5-donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Mouse anti-calbindin was applied last followed by FITC-donkey anti-mouse IgG. After the retinas were rinsed, they were mounted on slides, ganglion cell side up in 3 1 glycerol-PBSA with 0.01% paraphenylenediamine Sigma . Con-trols were performed by processing tissue as described above but without primary antibodies. No selective label-ing was observed. We examined the retinas in a confocal laser-scanning microscope Zeiss, Thornwood, NY with a krypton-argon laser. Excitation was at 488 nm for FITC, 568 nm for Cy3, and 647 nm for Cy5. The emission filters were 515â540 nm for FITC, 590â610 nm for Cy3, and 670â810 nm for Cy5.At the magnifications used, the different wavelengths were aligned within 1 Î¼m. Linear measurements on the images and interactive analysis of the image stacks was per-formed by using Zeiss LSM software. Photoshop 3.0 Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA was used to process the confocal images. For statistical analysis of data from confocal images, a one-way analysis of variance ANOVA with a random effect model was used to compare the mean difference between original and controls. The computation was performed by SAS version 6.12 software Cary, NC . Electron microscopy Retinas for electron microscopy were fixed and pro-cessed as described in the previous article Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 . The Neurobiotin in the injected cells was visualized by using avidin-biotin-peroxidase and diamino-benzidine DAB with hydrogen peroxide. Retinas were then rinsed and incubated for 7â10 days in 1 1,500 mono-clonal mouse anti-calbindin D-28K Sigma in PBS with 0.3% sodium azide, rinsed in PBS, and then incubated for 2 days in 1 100 biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG Vector Laboratories in PBS.Avidin-biotin-peroxidase 1 100 and DAB as described above, were used to visualize the calbindin immunoreactivity. Double-labeled tissue was then treated with osmium tetroxide 1% in PB, 60 min-utes and embedded in Epon as whole mounts on slides, ganglion cell side up. The injected cell was cut out and reembedded for ultrathin sectioning as described previ-ously Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 . EAAT2 antibody generation Antibodies were generated to the C-terminal 85 amino acid residues of hEAAT2 by using a glutathione-S-transferase GST fusion protein strategy. The complemen-tary deoxyribonucleic acid cDNA sequence encoding this region, KSELDTIDSQHRVEDIEMTKTQSIYDDMKNHRESNQCVYAAHNSNQCVYAAHNSVIVDECKVTLAANGKSADCSVEEEPWKREK was subcloned into the pGEX-KT vector Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden and verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI 373 automated sequencer. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose beads and used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits Hazelton Research Products, Denver, PA . The reactivity of the antiserum was characterized on Western blots. The fusion protein antigen was also used to confirm the specificity of the antiserum in blocking experiments. Tissue preparation for Western blotting Macaque retinas or rat cortical tissues 3-week-old, Sprague-Dawley were dissected, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 280Â°C. Frozen tissue was crushed on dry ice, diluted 1 10 w v in ice-cold buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS , 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol DTT , 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA , pH 8.0, and solubilized by douncing 50 times. Acocktail of protease inhibitors Complete protease inhibi-tors Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN was in-cluded in the homogenization buffer 1 tablet per 10 ml . The homogenate was incubated at 100Â°C for 4 minutes, processed four times each through 20-and 26-gauge needles, spun at 10,000 3 g at 4Â°C, and the supernatant was frozen at 220Â°C. Oocyte membrane preparation Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of either hEAAT2 RNA or water and assayed for transport activity 48â72 hours after injection. hEAAT2-expressing oocytes, voltage clamped at 260 mV, elicited a current of 90 nA when assayed with 300 Î¼M glutamate. Oocytes were homog-enized by pipetting in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 7.5 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 20 Î¼g ml phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF , 1 Î¼g ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g ml aprotinin, and 1 Î¼g ml pepstatin. Homogenized oocytes were spun 750 3 g at 4Â°C for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was removed to a new tube and then spun at 16,000 3 g after which the supernatant was discarded Preston et al., 1993 . The pellet was then solubilized in the same lysis buffer containing 2% SDS and denatured at 100Â°C for 3 minutes. Oocyte membrane homogenates were stored at 220Â°C for up to 3 months. Western blotting Protein homogenates denatured at 100Â°C for 3 minutes in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE loading buffer containing 100mM DTT were fractionated on an 8% gel under denaturing conditions then transferred to Im-mobilon P Millipore, Bedford, MA for 16 hours at 38 mA in a 10% MeOH transfer buffer. Membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk, 2% BSA, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and then incubated with anti-hEAAT2 1 5,000 or preincubated overnight with either GST 0.7 Î¼g ml or GST-hEAAT2 0.7 Î¼g ml . Blots were then pro-cessed as described in Eliasof et al. 1998 . RESULTS Western blotting analyses confirmed the specificity of the hEAAT2 antibody used in these studies hEAAT2 RNA-injected oocytes expressed a 73 kDa protein species that was not detected by the serum in control water-injected oocytes. Binding of anti-hEAAT2 was blocked by preabsorption with the fusion protein data not shown . A similar protein of 73 kDa is observed in rat cortex, consistent with results from previous studies using antibod-ies to GLT-1, the rat homolog of hEAAT2, in rat brain Lehre et al., 1995 Rothstein et al., 1994 Danbolt et al., 1992 , and in rat retina Rauen et al., 1996 . In monkey retina two bands were observed, one at 73 kDa and a second at 37 kDa Fig. 1 both bands were abolished by preabsorption of the serum with the fusion protein. The lower molecular weight band at 37 kDa was also present in human retina and appears to represent a proteolytic fragment of hEAAT2 data not shown . Others also have identified a major 73 kDa protein species and a second lower molecular weight band at 37 kDa in rat cortex using a different C-terminally directed antibody against GLT-1 Lehre et al., 1995 . DB3 diffuse cone bipolar cells were labeled with antibod-ies to calbindin D28k CaBP in macaque retinas. They have characteristic, varicose axon terminals consisting of axonal swellings separated by narrow connecting regions. Figure 2 shows a camera lucida drawing of DB3 axons from a whole mount immunolabeled for calbindin. The descending axons coming from the cell bodies black dots typically branched two to three times average, 2.4 before any varicosities occurred, and each subsequently branched one or two more times. The second-and third-order branches almost always occurred at varicosities arrows . Like Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle 1991 , we found that many DB3 axons appeared to contact neighboring axons, and this made it difficult to distinguish individual axon terminals. On closer examination, however, there were always points on the labeled axon terminals where two varicosities were apposed without any narrow connecting region between them. These appositions typically occurred between the tips of the axon terminals or between a tip and the side of a neighboring varicosity arrowheads . These were consid-ered the boundaries between neighboring cells, because in the preceding article Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 , they were found to be sites of gap junctions between DB3 cells. With use of this criterion, each DB3 cell contacted 1â4 neighboring cells average, 2.4 by way of 1â7 average, 3.4 such appositions, giving an average of 1.4 appositions between neighboring cells. There were 19â52 average, 33 6 4.7 varicosities per DB3 cell n 5 13 in this area of retina. The eccentricity of this area was estimated from the density of cones there were 123 cones in a square area 200Î¼m on a side or a cone density of 3,075 mm2, which corresponds to an eccentricity of 11â12 mm Packer et al., 1989 . Despite the frequent appositions between neighboring DB3 axon terminals, there was little overlap between individual terminals, a finding suggesting that the axons have distinct territories, like other mammalian bipolar cells Cohen and Sterling, 1990 Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Mills and Massey, 1992 Massey and Mills, 1996 . The tiling pattern was not completely homogeneous, however. There were irregular gaps in the matrix that were larger than the spaces between other types of bipolar cell axons in primates. Other bipolar cell axons are thought to tile the retina in a space-filling manner Boycott and WaÂ¨ssle, 1991 . Calbindin-IR bipolar cells and a population of wide-field bipolar cells in the rabbit retina, however, exhibit occasional gaps in the axonal matrix similar to those of DB3 axons Jeon and Masland, 1995 Massey and Mills, 1996 . Both of these types of rabbit bipolar cells also have axons that contact neighboring terminals, but unlike DB3 cells, they ramify in the inner IPL or ON sublamina. To estimate the coverage of DB3 axons, axonal areas were measured and multiplied by the local DB3 cell density. The average DB3 axonal area in Figure 2 was 2,129 6 460 Î¼m2, and the density was 360 cells mm2, giving a coverage factor of 0.77. Double-label EM Double-label experiments were performed to determine whether DB3 axons and OFF parasol cell dendrites were in the same layer of the macaque IPL, as suggested by Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle 1991 and Martin and Gru Â¨nert 1992 . Parasol cells were intracellularly injected, and vertical sections containing labeled parasol cell dendrites were labeled with anti-CaBP. The DB3 axons ramified in a narrow stratum of the IPL at a depth of 30â45%, taking 0% to be the outer edge and 100% the inner edge of the IPL. We found that the beaded axons of DB3 cells traveled in the same narrow stratum of the IPL as dendrites from Neurobiotin-filled OFF parasol cells, and there were exten-sive appositions between them, as in marmoset retina Ghosh et al., 1997 . To determine whether peripheral OFF parasol ganglion cells receive synapses from DB3 bipolar cells, we analyzed double-labeled material in the electron microscope. Figure 3 shows a lightly labeled CaBP-IR DB3 axon presynaptic to two, more darkly labeled OFF parasol cell dendrites at two different ribbons arrowheads this arrangement was seen twice in our survey of this material. The parasol cell was more densely labeled than the DB3 axons, presumably because it was iontophoretically filled with Neurobiotin and reacted twice with DAB. Even though lightly labeled, the CaBP-IR axons could be distinguished from unlabeled bipolar cells because of the reaction product around the synaptic vesicles and synaptic ribbons. This is illustrated at a higher magnification in Figure 4 where another DB3 axon terminal is making a ribbon synapse onto a parasol cell dendrite. For comparison, an unlabeled bipolar cell can be seen making a ribbon synapse in the upper right corner of Figure 4. The double-labeled material was not analyzed quantitatively, but it is our impression that synapses occur at nearly every apposition between labeled DB3 and OFF parasol cells. Appositions between DB3 bipolar cells and parasol cells Double-label electron microscopy provides direct evi-dence of synapses between immunolabeled DB3 bipolar cells and injected OFF parasol cells, but the technique is very time-consuming and technically difficult. It would be advantageous, therefore, to be able to estimate the probabil-ity that two sets of processes form synapses using light microscopy. The method we chose was to count the number of appositions, or regions where the processes are adjacent to one another, and compare this with the expected num-ber of randomly occurring appositions between costratified processes. In the retina Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 and elsewhere in the nervous system, approximately half of the appositions were found to be sites of synaptic contact Mann et al., 1997 . Therefore, we assumed that processes that made more appositions with parasol cells than ex-pected by chance were likely to be presynaptic and that processes that made no more appositions than expected by chance were not likely to be presynaptic. We tested this method first on DB3-OFF parasol cell appositions. Both sets of processes ran in a plane tangential to the retinal surface, making quantitative analysis of their spatial relationship difficult using vertical sections Fig. 5 . There-fore, flat-mounted material was used for the remaining experiments. When the two sets of processes are densely distributed, like DB3 axons and parasol cell dendrites, a certain number of appositions are expected to occur by chance, whether there are synapses between the adjacent pro-cesses or not. It is essential to distinguish these random appositions from selective appositions, which are likely to be sites of synapses. To determine whether there were more appositions between a given pair of processes than would be expected because of chance, we used a method adapted from Vardi et al. 1989 and Massey et al. 1996 to compare the number of appositions in images, such as Figure 6, with rotated control images of the same area Jacoby et al., 1996 . Figure 6 represents a reconstructed stack of optical sections through the distal half of the IPL containing parasol cell dendrites red and DB3 axons green . Virtually all the ribbon synapses from DB3 cells occur in the varicosities, or axonal swellings, where the diameter of the axon is .0.4 Î¼m according to our EM analysis Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 . It is not known where synapses are localized along parasol cell dendrites, however, and therefore, appositions arrows were counted whenever a DB3 axonal varicosity was adjacent to any part of the parasol dendrite. Appositions were not counted solely from reconstructed images, such as Figure 6, be-cause apparent appositions between two processes in the x-y plane may, in fact, be separated along the z-axis and artifactually superimposed. Instead, appositions were counted interactively by scanning through the stacks of serial, optical sections. Appositions were only counted if the two processes were in the same or in adjacent sections. Because the z-axis resolution of the confocal microscope was typically 0.6 Î¼m and the step size between sections was usually 0.4 Î¼m, two processes in adjacent sections could be separated by as much as 1 Î¼m. With use of these criteria, all of the apparent appositions illustrated in Figure 6 were counted. Control images were created by rotating one of the two fluorescence signals relative to the other in the x-y axis. Figure 7 shows an example of a control image in which the Neurobiotin-Cy3 channel red has been rotated 90Â° relative to the CaBP-IR-Cy5 channel green , which is in the same orientation as Figure 6. The arrows point out random appositions between the two processes. Appositions were counted in control images after 90, 120, and 180Â° of rotation for each area. The control images had 37% fewer appositions, on average, than the original images Table 1 . Therefore, DB3 axons make significantly more appositions with OFF parasol cells than would be expected from chance one-wayANOVA, P , 0.001 . It was also important to control for the influence of vertically oriented Mu Â¨ller cell processes and ON bipolar cell axons running through the IPL. These processes might limit the number of paths available for processes ramifying in the outer half of the IPL, and this could explain why there are more appositions in the original images than there are in control images. The situation could be likened to people walking through a thick forest. They all must walk between the trees, and therefore, the likelihood of one person walking the same path as another person is higher than if the trees were not there. To examine the effect of vertically oriented elements, appositions were counted in reconstructed images that contained dendrites from an injected ON parasol cell, ramifying in sublamina b, and the DB3 axons from the same area, which ramify in sublamina a. Although these two sets of processes were in the same field x-y plane , there were no actual appositions between them because they were separated along the z-axis, in different focal planes. However, if vertically oriented processes were responsible for our results from OFF parasol cells and DB3 axons in sublamina a of the IPL, then processes in sublamina b should also be limited to the same paths because of the columnar Mu Â¨ller cells and descending axons traveling through the IPL. In that case, when ON parasol cell dendrites and DB3 axons are overlaid into the same image and viewed in the flat-mount orientation for example, see Figs. 6â8 , there should also be more apparent appositions between them compared with control rotations, because both sets of processes would be confined to the same pathways. The number of appositions in original images between ON parasol cells and DB3 axons, however, was no different from the num-ber in control images Table 1 one-way ANOVA, P 5 0.6 . Therefore, vertically oriented processes were not respon-sible for the selective appositions between DB3 bipolar cells and OFF parasol cells. Some DB3 varicosities within the dendritic field of an injected parasol cell were not adjacent to any of the parasol cellâs dendrites one possible explanation is that they made appositions with other, unlabeled parasol cells. All of the areas analyzed contained dendrites from a single injected OFF parasol cell, but because the coverage factor for parasol cells is 3 Gru Â¨nert et al., 1993 Dacey, 1994 , every point on the retina is covered by dendrites from three different parasol cells. Thus, the areas that were analyzed in these experiments actually have 3 times as many parasol cell dendrites than are visible in the confocal micrographs. On average, 55% of the DB3 axonal varicosi-ties in each area were apposed to parasol cell dendrites. Taking into account the coverage factor for parasol cell dendrites, there would be 1.65 parasol cell appositions per DB3 axonal varicosity. Even if only half of the neuronal appositions seen in the light and electron microscope represent synapses Mann et al., 1997 Jacoby and Mar-shak, 2000 , a large majority of the DB3 varicosities would make synapses onto OFF parasol cell dendrites. Appositions between flat midget bipolar cells and parasol cells Because flat midget bipolar cell FMB axons ramify broadly in the distal half of the IPL at 10â40% depth, the lower portions of their axons overlap with OFF parasol cell dendrites and might provide input Boycott and WaÂ¨ssle, 1991 . In the central retinas of humans Kolb and Dekor-ver, 1991 and macaques Calkins et al., 1994 , midget bipolar cells contact only midget ganglion cells. However, in peripheral retina it is possible that parasol ganglion cells are also contacted. To examine whether there are appositions between FMB cells and peripheral parasol cells, FMB cells were labeled by using antiserum to the calcium-binding protein recoverin Milam et al., 1993 Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1994 Wiechmann, 1996 Yan and Wiech-mann, 1997 . In far peripheral retina, we found that the FMB axon plexus was relatively narrow, as described previously Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1994 . Most of the FMB axon terminals ramified distal to OFF parasol dendrites, preclud-ing contact between them. However, some were found among the OFF parasol cell dendrites, and a few were found even more proximally. To determine whether there were significantly more appositions between FMB axons and OFF parasol cell dendrites than expected by chance, double-labeled flat mounts were analyzed by using the same technique as was used for CaBP-IR axons. Figure 8 shows a reconstructed image from a stack of optical sections containing dendrites from an injected OFF para-sol cell red and recoverin-IR FMB axon terminals green . Arrows indicate actual appositions, and arrowheads indi- cate artifactual appositions where the processes were separated by more than one section in the z-axis. In reconstructed stacks, artifactual appositions were particu-larly common for FMB cells because of the broad stratifica-tion of their axons. There were no differences in the number of appositions between original images, such as Figure 8, and rotated control images Table 1 one-way ANOVA, P 5 0.63 . There were no more appositions between FMB axons and OFF parasol cells than would be expected because of chance, and therefore, it is unlikely that flat midget bipolar cells provide significant input to peripheral OFF parasol cells. DB2 bipolar cells Because axons of DB2 diffuse bipolar cells ramify throughout much of the outer half of the IPL sublamina a , they are also able to make appositions with OFF parasol ganglion cells. DB2 bipolar cells and flat midget bipolar cells can both be labeled with antiserum to a glutamate transporter, isolated from rat brain, called GLT-1 Rauen and Kanner, 1994 Gru Â¨nert et al., 1994 . In this study, we used an antiserum to the homolog, human excitatory amino acid transporter 2 hEAAT2 . It was important to determine first whether anti-hEAAT2 also labeled DB2 cone bipolar cells and FMB cells. Single-labeled vertical sections from midperipheral retina were reacted with anti-hEAAT2 and analyzed in the confocal microscope. Because of the high density of labeled axons, it was difficult to distinguish between axon termi-nals of DB2 bipolar cells and FMB axon terminals using anti-hEAAT2, alone. To determine whether both DB2 and FMB axons were labeled with anti-hEAAT2, vertical sec-tions were labeled with both anti-recoverin and anti-hEAAT2 Fig. 9 . This would normally not be possible because both antibodies had been raised in rabbits, but because recoverin-IR is present throughout the cytoplasm Fig. 8 and hEAAT2-IR is limited to the vicinity of the plasma membrane Fig. 9a,c , there is a built-in control for nonspecific staining. For example, if the fluorophore used to visualize anti-hEAAT2 were found throughout the cyto-plasm, then it is cross-reacting with the recoverin anti-body. In our material, however, the cross-reactivity was minimal. As shown in Figure 9a,b, recoverin-IR green was found in the cytoplasm of axonal varicosities at the top of the IPL arrows , where FMB axons ramify Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 hEAAT2-IR red was localized to the membranes of axonal varicosities throughout the distal half of the IPL Fig. 9a,c arrowheads . All of the recov-erin-IR varicosities were double-labeled, but most of the smaller hEAAT2-IR varicosities closer to the middle of the IPL were not recoverin-IR. These hEAAT2-IR-recoverin-negative varicosities were broadly stratified like DB2 axons Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 . DB3 axons blue la-beled with anti-CaBP were also included in Figure 9aâc to show the relative depths of stratification of the three bipolar cell types. Thus, antisera to hEAAT2 appear to label FMB and DB2 bipolar cells, as do antisera to GLT-1 Gru Â¨nert et al., 1994 . In our whole mounts, however, hEAAT 2-immunoreac-tive processes were very dense, and it was not possible to discern the boundaries between individual bipolar cell axon terminals or to distinguish between DB2 axons and FMB axons. Therefore, it was not possible to count the appositions between DB2 bipolar cells and OFF parasol cells or to determine whether they were selective by the technique used earlier. There appeared to be many more appositions between hEAAT 2-IR axons and OFF parasol cells than with recoverin-IR FMB axons and OFF parasol cells in vertical sections, however. This finding predicts that DB2 bipolar cells provide input to OFF parasol cells, as reported in a previous study of unlabeled tissue from central retina Calkins, 1999 . Convergence onto parasol cells To determine how many cones and DB3 bipolar cells would be expected to provide input to parasol cells, double-labeled flat mounts were optically sectioned at the level of the parasol cell dendrites, the DB3 cell bodies, and the cone inner segments. DB3 cell bodies and the cone inner segments overlying two parasol cell dendritic fields were counted. The eccentricity was estimated by using the local cone density and the diameter of the parasol cellsâ den-dritic fields. Cell 1 had a dendritic field diameter of 200 Î¼m, and the overlying cone density was 7,448 mm2. From Watanabe and Rodieck 1989 and Packer et al. 1989 , the eccentricity is 6 mm. Cell 2 had a dendritic field diameter of 290 Î¼m and a local cone density of 5,667 mm2 , and therefore, the eccentricity is 10 mm. The number of cones that fell inside the area of a parasol cell dendritic field was 240 for cell 1 and 281 for cell 2, and the number including those on the edge of the field was 250 for cell 1 and 296 for cell 2. This finding agrees with Goodchild et al. 1996 who showed that the cone convergence onto macaque parasol cells changed very little, remaining around 200 at eccen-tricities .6 mm. There were 43 DB3 bipolar cells con-tained entirely within the dendritic field of parasol cell 1 and 53 for cell 2. Including the DB3 cells on the edge of the dendritic field, there were 48 DB3 cells converging onto cell 1 and 55 DB3 cells onto cell 2. With 50 DB3 cells converging onto a typical parasol cell in midperipheral retina, there would be 50 3 33 axonal varicosities DB3 cell 5 1,650 DB3 axonal varicosities overlying the parasol cell dendrites. Because 55% of the DB3 varicosities in each area contact a single parasol cell, each parasol cell would be expected to make appositions with 908 0.55 3 1,650 DB3 varicosities in midperipheral retina. Because parasol cells have a coverage factor of 3, however, there would be 1.65 parasol cell appositions per DB3 varicosity, as de-scribed earlier. Also, there are, at most, only 1.12 synapses per DB3 varicosity available for parasol cells Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 . Therefore, at the upper limit, there could be synapses at 68% 1.12 1.65 , or 617 of the 908 DB3 parasol cell appositions. If only 47% of the appositions represent synapses, as we demonstrated for all processes that appose DB3 axons Jacoby and Marshak, 2000 , then each parasol cell would receive 427 synapses from DB3 cells. Depending on how many other types of ganglion cells receive input from DB3 cells, parasol cells would receive from 427 to 617 synapses from 50 DB3 bipolar cells summarized in Fig. 10 . DISCUSSION Axons from three types of bipolar cells FMB, DB2, and DB3 ramify in the same narrow stratum of the IPL as dendrites from OFF parasol ganglion cells. With use of double-label EM, we found that DB3 bipolars made syn-apses onto OFF parasol cells, and by using double-label confocal microscopy, DB3 bipolars made significantly more appositions with parasol cell dendrites than would be expected because of chance. These findings predict that other presynaptic cells would also make more appositions then expected by chance. FMB axons labeled with anti-recoverin did not make any more appositions with parasol cells than would be expected by chance, however. There-fore, we concluded that FMB cells do not provide signifi-cant input to peripheral OFF parasol cells. One other bipolar cell input to parasol ganglion cells was studied qualitatively. DB2 bipolar cells were labeled with anti-hEAAT2, and their axons made more appositions with OFF parasol cells than FMB cells did, a finding suggesting that they provide input, as well. Bipolar cell inputs to parasol ganglion cells A summary diagram of the proposed bipolar cell inputs to OFF parasol cells is shown in Figure 11. In a recent study, it was reported that narrowly stratifying bipolar cells resembling DB3 cells provided 71% of the bipolar cell input to a parasol ganglion cell in parafoveal retina Calkins et al., 1995 Calkins, 1999 . The remainder of the bipolar cell input 29% came from broadly stratifying bipolar cells that resembled DB2 cells. Synapses from FMB cells onto parasol cells have not been observed in central retina Kolb and DeKorver, 1991 Calkins et al., 1994 . Thus, our results in peripheral retina are consistent with the hypothesis that parasol ganglion cells receive input from two populations of diffuse bipolar cells, DB2 and DB3 cells, at all eccentricities. On the basis of confocal microscopy, we found that parasol cells from the midperipheral retina received 500 synapses from 43â55 DB3 bipolar cells. In the central retina, however, a serially reconstructed parasol cell received 60 synapses from 4 DB3 cells Calkins et al., 1995 Calkins, 1999 . The same foveal parasol cell received 25 synapses from 3 DB2 bipolar cells, for a total of 85 bipolar cell synapses. If peripheral parasol cells receive the same proportion of DB2 and DB3 inputs i.e., 30% and 70% , they should receive 200 synapses from 38 DB2 bipolar cells, giving a total of roughly 700 synapses from all types of bipolar cells. ON parasol ganglion cells from the peripheral baboon retina received 20% of their synapses from bipolar cells, but the remaining 80% were from amacrine cells Jacoby et al., 1996 . If we assume that OFF parasol cells have the same proportion of bipolar and amacrine input as ON cells, then midperipheral parasol cells could receive .2,800 synapses from amacrine cells, in addition to the 700 from bipolar cells, giving approximately 3,500 input synapses altogether. Kolb and Nelson 1993 estimated that a cat alpha ganglion cell with a dendritic field diameter of 800 Î¼m received 6,150â9,500 synapses, and a beta cell with a dendritic field diameter of 62 Î¼m received 1,000 syn-apses. Because the parasol cells analyzed here had den-dritic field diameters of 200 and 290 Î¼m, the results from cat retina had to be scaled to compare with our data. The alpha cell was roughly 3 times larger in diameter than our parasol cell, and therefore, the dendritic field area would be 9 times larger. Because the density of synapses onto alpha ganglion cells per unit area of dendritic field retinal density decreases only slightly with eccentricity Kier et al., 1995 , we would expect 940 synapses onto an alpha cell the size of our parasol cells. These results suggest that the density of synapses onto parasol cells is significantly higher than for cat alpha cells. Correspondingly, the dendritic field area of the beta cell from Kolb and Nelson 1993 was 16 times smaller than those of our parasol cells. The retinal density of synapses onto beta cells, however, decreases by a factor of 5 over this 16-fold increase in dendritic field area Kier et al., 1995 , so that we would expect only a 3-fold increase in the number of synapses onto a beta cell the size of our parasol cells. This gives an estimate of 3,000 synapses, which is about 15% less than our estimate for the parasol cells. In summary, the density of synapses onto parasol ganglion cells might be as much as 1.5 times higher than for cat beta cells, and as much as 4 times that of cat alpha cells. Comparisons with other species On the basis of similarities in axonal morphology and stratification, cone bipolar cells from other mammals appear to be similar to primate DB3 and DB2 bipolar cells. Those with narrowly stratifying axons in sublamina a of the IPL, like DB3, include types Cb2 Kolb et al., 1981 , CBa1 cell 14 and CBa4 McGuire et al., 1984 from cat retina, types ma2 Famiglietti, 1981 and DAPI-Ba3 Mills and Massey, 1992 from rabbit retina, and type CB5 from rat retina Euler and Wa Â¨ssle, 1995 . Cat Cb2 bipolar cells hyperpolarize to light increments in their receptive field centers Nelson and Kolb, 1983 , and DB3 cells would be expected to have similar light responses. Cone bipolar cells with broadly stratifying axons in sublamina a, like DB2, include types Cb1 Kolb et al., 1981 and CBa2 McGuire et al., 1984 from cat, DAPI-Ba2 cells from rabbit Mills and Massey, 1992 , and type CB3 bipolar cells from rat Euler and Wa Â¨ssle, 1995 . Thus, all mammals studied to date have multiple types of cone bipolar cells, even those considered to have rod-dominated vision. This suggests that there are functional requirements for multiple diffuse bipolar cell pathways between cones and ganglion cells and that these are conserved in evolution. Cat homologs of DB2 and DB3 bipolar cells would be expected to provide input to ganglion cells homologous to parasol cells. In many respects, alpha ganglion cells from cats are similar to parasol ganglion cells Peichl, 1991 Rodieck et al., 1993 Jacoby et al., 1996 . Both are among the largest ganglion cells in their respective retinas, have narrowly stratified dendrites, and show tracer coupling to similar types of wide-field, axon-bearing amacrine cells. OFF alpha ganglion cells receive all of their bipolar cell input from cb2 bipolar cells Kolb and Nelson, 1993 . DB3 bipolar cells provide most of the bipolar cell input to OFF parasol cells Calkins, 1999 , and these results are consis-tent with homology between parasol cells and alpha cells. However, parasol cells are also similar to cat beta ganglion cells in absolute size and in dendritic morphology. OFF beta cells receive input from both cb1 and cb2 bipolar cells Kolb and Nelson, 1993 , and McGuire et al. 1986 found that OFF beta cells received 66% of their bipolar cell input from CBa1 bipolar cells and the remainder from CBa2 cells. This ratio is similar to that for parasol cells, which receive 71% of their bipolar cell input from DB3 cells and the remainder from DB2 cells Calkins et al., 1995 Calkins, 1999 . Although these results do not indicate which cat ganglion cells are homologous to parasol cells, they do support homology between primate DB3 bipolar cells and cat cb2-CBa1 bipolar cells, and between primate DB2 cells and cat cb1-CBa2 cells.

Neurol. 416 262â268, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The myelin proteolipid proteins are a class of hydropho-bic, integral membrane proteins first characterized as a major structural component of central nervous system CNS myelin. There are two known isoforms expressed from the single, X-linked Plp gene by alternative splicing Nave et al., 1987 . The resulting proteins, PLP and DM20, differ only by a 35-amino-acid domain present in PLP but not DM20. The function of the myelin proteolipid proteins in CNS myelin structure has been well documented. Myelin that is deficient in PLP DM20 has an altered periodicity, with abnormally compacted intraperiod line Duncan et al., 1987, 1989 Klugmann et al., 1997 . Muta-tions in the Plp gene also inhibit oligodendrocyte develop-ment, resulting in dysmyelination, tremors, and, in most mutants, premature death Hudson and Nadon, 1992 . The global effect on oligodendrocyte development is evi-dent from the fact that expression of all myelin genes is reduced in the Plp mutants Nadon and Duncan, 1995, 1996 . Inhibition of oligodendrocyte development is a dominant effect of the mutant protein. Expression of wild-type PLP and DM20 transgenes is inhibited when they are bred into Plp mutant mice, whereas oligodendro-cyte development is unaffected in Plp gene knockout mice Nadon et al., 1994 Schneider et al., 1995 Klugmann et al., 1997 . Isoform-specific roles for PLP and DM20 have not been determined. Rescue experiments suggested that both iso-forms are required for oligodendrocyte development Na- don et al., 1994 . These findings are supported by in vitro transfection experiments indicating that DM20 assists in the translocation of PLP to the cell surface Timsit et al., 1992a Sinoway et al., 1994 Gow et al., 1994 Thomson et al., 1997 . In the rumpshaker Plp mutant mouse, which expresses significant amounts of DM20 on the oligodendro-cyte surface, correction of the abnormal myelin structure was achieved by adding wild-type PLP alone by way of a transgene Nadon and West, 1998 . However, normalizing the myelin structure did not correlate with alleviation of the oligodendrocyte developmental block. This suggests that, although the rumpshaker DM20 was capable of assisting transport of wild-type PLP to the cell surface, other molecules that participate in signaling oligodendro-cyte development are still deficient. We have hypothesized that DM20 and or PLP is involved in transport of mol-ecules that function in signal pathway s essential for oligodendrocyte development and that mutations in the Plp gene disrupt that transport in oligodendrocytes Na-don and West, 1998 . A transport function involving DM20 may not be specific to oligodendrocytes but may be utilized by other cell types. DM20 mRNA but not PLP mRNA is expressed in a wide range of nonmyelinating tissues Campagnoni et al., 1992 Ikenaka et al., 1992 Timsit et al., 1992b Nadon et al., 1997 . Analysis of PLP DM20 expression in the peripheral nervous system PNS supports an alternative function for DM20 independent of myelination. DM20 and PLP are expressed at moderate levels in Schwann cells of the PNS, although the proteins do not incorporate into the myelin but remain in the cell bodies Puckett et al., 1987 Agrawal and Agrawal., 1991 Griffiths et al., 1995 . Plp gene expression is not coordinately regulated with Schwann cell development, and mutations in the Plp gene do not affect the level of expression of the gene in the PNS as they do in the CNS Gupta et al., 1991 Kamholz et al., 1992 Nadon et al., 1997 . However, there is at least one report of peripheral neuropathy in a family with Pelizeaus Merz-bacher disease resulting from a null mutation in the Plp gene, suggesting that DM20 and or PLP does function in the PNS Garbern et al., 1997 . Overexpression of DM20 and PLP in the PNS with cDNA-based transgenes demon-strated the first definitive difference between DM20 and PLP proteins PLP was incorporated into the PNS myelin sheath, whereas DM20 remained in the cell body Ander-son et al., 1997 . Together, these findings are consistent with a role for DM20 in intracellular transport vesicles in Schwann cells. In this report, evidence is presented that DM20 may also function in signal pathways that influence neuronal devel-opment. A mutant form of DM20 was expressed from a transgene at very low levels. Aged mice expressing this transgene showed aberrant neurite growth in the white matter of the spinal cord. The hypothesis is presented that mutant DM20 alters signaling between oligodendrocytes and neurons, causing the aberrant neurite outgrowth. MATERIALS AND METHODS The DM20*ShP transgenic mice were produced by con-ventional microinjection methods. The DM20*ShP con-struct is identical to the wild-type DM20 construct previ-ously reported Nadon et al., 1994 , with the exception of the His36 Pro point mutation found in the shaking pup mutant Nadon et al., 1990 . Engineering of the mutant construct has been described, as has polymerase chain reaction PCR assay to genotype the transgenic mice Nadon and Draeger, 1996 Nadon et al., 1997 . Reverse transcriptase PCR RT-PCR was performed as described by Kawasaki and Wang 1989 , using 3 Î¼g of total RNA as the template.Amplification from the transgene mRNAwas accomplished with primers specific to the 38-untranslated region of the human PLP gene-derived transgene sense, 58-CTCGAAGTCACAAAGGAATGGAGG antisense, 58-GATGCCCCCTTCGTCTACACAGATT . All thermocycling protocols were 95Â°C for 1 minute, 65Â°C for 3 minutes. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2.0% agarose gels for 2 hours at 80 V. The specificity of the primers for the transgene has been demonstrated by sequencing RT-PCR products from several tissues, with all products conform-ing to the PLP DM20 sequence Nadon et al., 1997 . Transgenic mice are hemizygous for the transgene unless otherwise noted, and wild-type control mice are B6C3F1, the background on which the transgenes are maintained. All procedures with mice were approved by the IACUC and conform with NIH guidelines. For electron microscopy, mice were anesthetized first with Metafane inhalation and then with choral hydrate intraperitoneal injection of 0.4 g kg body weight . Perfu-sion of the mice and sectioning of the cervical spinal cords have been described elsewhere Nadon et al., 1994 . Spinal cord sections were photographed on the electron micro-scope and negatives printed without retouching. The g ratio diameter of axon divided by the diameter of axon plus myelin sheath was measured from electron micro-graphs. Statistical analysis was performed with InStat GraphPad, San Diego, CA . Northern blot hybridization assays were performed using total RNA as described elsewhere Nadon et al., 1994 . Direct quantitation of the amount of probe hybridized to Northern blots was per-formed on an AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System RIS Scanalytics, San Diego, CA , by isolating each lane on the scan, subtracting baselevel backgrounds, and determining the number of counts in each peak within the lane. Probes for Northern blots were from a mouse MBP cDNA de Ferra et al., 1985 or the human PLP cDNA Puckett et al., 1987 , the full-length cDNA to measure total PLP DM20 mRNA levels, or the 38-untranslated region to measure specifically the transgene mRNA levels. A rat cDNA clone for cyclophilin Milner and Sutcliffe, 1983 , which is ex-pressed in all cells, was used as the internal control in all Northern blots. Cell death assays using the TUNEL method were per-formed with the In Situ Cell Death kit according to the manufacturerâs protocol Boehringer Mannheim, India-napolis, IN . Statistical analysis was by the Unpaired t test using InStat GraphPad, San Diego, CA . Immunocy-tochemistry was performed on 10 Î¼m frozen sections with the Vectastain ABC kit as described by the manufacturer Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA . The PLP DM20 antibody was purchased from Immunodiagnostics Bed-ford, MA , MacI detects macrophages and microglia and glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP antibodies from Boeh-ringer Mannheim Indianapolis, IN , and SMI32 detects non-phosphorylated neurofilaments antibody from Stern-berger Monoclonals Inc. Lutherville, MD . The CD3 anti-body to detect T cells was a gift from Dr. Linda Thompson. DISCUSSION Expression of the DM20*ShP transgene at very low levels does not adversely affect development of myelina-tion in the CNS, nor does it inhibit expression of the endogenous Plp gene at any time in development, includ-ing old age. Morphology of the spinal cord at both light and electron microscopic levels was also normal in young transgenic mice. However, some older DM20*ShP mice at least 9 months old exhibited abnormal growth of gray matter processes within white matter tracts of the cervical spinal cord. These processes were composed of dendrites synapsed to axonal terminals. Although this phenotype was observed in only one-third of the cervical spinal cords examined, it was observed in both lines of DM20*ShP mice and in both genders. The incidence may have been higher than we observed in the cervical spinal cord if other areas of the CNS were similarly affected. This phenotype is not seen in young DM20*ShP mice, in young or old wild-type mice, in mice with mutations in the endogenous PLP gene, or in young or old transgenic mice expressing wild-type PLP or DM20 transgenes. There was also a marked cellular response in the CNS of the DM20*ShP mice. Increased apoptotic cell death in all white matter tracts was evident even in the absence of large-scale neurite outgrowth in white matter. There was an increase in macrophages microglia and T cells in the white matter, as well as focal areas of astrocytic hypertrophy. Interpretation of these results is limited by the fact that expression of the transgene at the protein level cannot be directly demonstrated, as wild-type DM20 and DM20*ShP differ by only one amino acid, and there are no antibodies that would distinguish between them. With that caveat in mind, it is unlikely that the neurite outgrowth is caused by overexpression of DM20, unrelated to the mutation, be-cause the transgene is expressed at such low levels com-pared to the endogenous gene level the transgene mRNA level is less than 2% the level of endogenous PLP DM20 mRNA . The phenotype has also not been seen in trans-genic mice expressing wild-type PLP and DM20 trans-genes at 50â70% of the endogenous gene level. The low penetrance of the phenotype may be a result of the low level of expression of the transgene. Likewise, growth of dendrite processes in the white matter may not be evident until old age simply because it takes that long for the low levels of mutant protein to accumulate to a critical level. Alternatively, there may be a physiological difference in old neurons, perhaps owing to accumulated genetic dam-age, that renders them more susceptible to the effects of the mutant protein. Myelin contains potent inhibitors of neurite outgrowth reviewed in Schwab et al., 1993 . However, there are examples of dendrites extending into regions of the brain composed predominantly of myelinated fibers Valverde, 1962 Iwahori, 1978, Silver and Brand, 1979 . Silver and Brand 1979 demonstrated dendrites from neurons within the suprachiasmatic nuclei intermingling with myelinated axons within the optic chiasm in an elegant study combin-ing Golgi staining and electron microscopy. Dendritic plasticity in the CNS is a normal response to aging. These changes consist primarily of dendritic loss or retraction, but there are also region-specific increases in neurite outgrowth in the brain during normal aging, thought to be compensatory mechanism for neuronal loss Coleman and Flood, 1986 . Although these studies have all been conducted with the brain, they demonstrate that dendritic plasticity in the CNS is part of the normal developmental program. Neu-rite outgrowth in the spinal cord has not been observed in any of our experiments, nor has it been reported in the literature. This suggests that expression of the DM20*ShP transgene may alter the plasticity of spinal cord neurons to allow or promote neurite outgrowth. This action could be mediated by a change in the environment, such that signals to the neurons are altered, or by molecular changes within the myelin that reduce the inhibition of neurite outgrowth. It is clear that a protein that has been traditionally thought to function only in glia is able to influence neurons. This is not the first evidence of a neuronal influence by the myelin proteolipid proteins. Griffiths et al. 1998 reported that Plp gene knockout mice exhibited neuronal degeneration in old age. Focal swellings of myelin-ated axons that contained spheroid bodies and mitochon-dria were evident by 2 months of age, suggesting a defect in axonal transport. Axonal degeneration, however, was not evident until the mice were at least 1 year old. Neurodegeneration was reduced by adding back wild-type PLP or DM20 by way of transgenes. The axonal swellings in the Plp knockout mice were initially located near the paranodes, a likely place for signaling between oligodendro-cyte and axon to occur. It is intriguing that overexpression of the Plp gene also results in neurodegeneration and demyelination in aged mice, suggested to result from a defect at the axonâoligodendrocyte interface Anderson et al., 1998 . Together, these findings indicate that oligoden-drocytes provide a signal for neurons, one that is tightly regulated and of particular importance as the mice age. Loss of the signal from oligodendrocytes adversely affects long-term neuronal survival in the Plp knockout mice, whereas expression of the mutant DM20*ShP transgene stimulates neurite outgrowth by interrupting normal sig-nals or relaying aberrant signals. We previously hypothesized that DM20 may assist in the transport of molecules to the oligodendrocyte surface, specifically molecules involved in signal transduction dur-ing oligodendrocyte maturation Nadon and West, 1998 . Our current findings suggest that DM20 may also partici-pate in transport of molecules that function in signaling between oligodendrocyte and axon. In the DM20*ShP transgenic mice, mutant DM20 may interact with wild-type DM20 to form a complex that alters its ability to traffic to the correct cellular compartment. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, when the DM20*ShP trans-gene is expressed at even moderate levels, it disrupts embryonic CNS development, resulting in embryonic le-thality shortly after DM20 expression begins Nadon et al., 1997 . Because the shaking pup mutation is not embryonic lethal by itself, this suggests that combination of the mutant protein from the transgene and wild-type protein from the X-linked endogenous gene is responsible for the embryonic lethality from the transgene. A similar complex in aged DM20*ShP oligodendrocytes may cause incorrect signaling to the axon by altering the levels of secreted or surface molecules. Yamada et al. 1999 reported that a fragment from the C-terminus of the PLP DM20 protein is secreted in the premyelinating CNS and that this frag-ment stimulated glial cell lines to divide in culture. This work illustrates another mechanism by which the DM20*ShP protein might interact with neurons. Under-standing oligodendrocyteâaxon signaling will provide for more direct investigation of neuropathy associated with dysmyelinating and demyelinating disorders and perhaps even normal aging. RESULTS DM20*ShP transgene is expressed in the CNS The DM20*ShP transgene construct consists of the human DM20 cDNA with 1.5 kb of 38-flanking DNA from the human Plp gene providing the natural transcription termination and polyadenylation signals Nadon et al., 1994 . The DM20*ShP cDNA contains the point mutation found in the shaking pup canine mutant, which encodes a His36 Pro substitution Nadon et al., 1990 . The pro-moter directing expression of the transgene is from the human Plp gene. It has been used extensively in this laboratory, and the tissue specificity of the promoter has been described elsewhere Nadon et al., 1994 Nadon and West, 1998 . When used with wild-type PLP and DM20 cDNA transgenes, this promoter was capable of directing expression of the transgene in CNS at near-endogenous levels Nadon et al., 1994 . However, the DM20*ShP transgene proved to be embryonic lethal when expressed at even moderate levels Nadon et al., 1997 . As a result, the two lines of transgenic mice obtained with the DM20*ShP construct have very low levels of expression, barely detectable by Northern blot hybridization data not shown . RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from brains of 3-week-old mice to demonstrate that the trans-gene is expressed in CNS. Transgene-specific primers generated an amplicon from both DM20*ShP lines Fig. 1, lanes 2, 3 as well as from a line of transgenic mice with a wild-type DM20 transgene under the same promoter Fig. 1, lane 4 . Myelination proceeds normally in the DM20*ShP transgenic mice Myelination develops normally in the DM20*ShP trans-genic mice, as illustrated in Figure 2. The amount of myelin per axon was measured in the dorsal funiculus of the spinal cord at 4 weeks of age, with a sample size of six mice per genotype. The g ratio diameter of axon divided by diameter of axon plus myelin was 0.71 for wild-type mice and 0.73 for DM20*ShP mice, a difference that is not statistically significant P 5 0.6790 by the unpaired t-test . Myelin gene expression was measured by quantitative Northern blot hybridization to determine if the transgene affected the myelination program. Expression of the endog-enous Plp and myelin basic protein Mbp genes was unaffected by the presence of the transgene throughout development Fig. 3 . Expression of the Plp gene was also analyzed in 9-and 11-month-old mice, and there was no difference between age-matched wild-type and DM20*ShP mice data not shown . There was no obvious difference in appearance or behavior between wild-type and DM20*ShP mice at any age. Aberrant dendrite growth in white matter occurs in older DM20*ShP transgenic mice Aged DM20*ShP transgenic mice 9 months and older exhibit sporadic areas of gray matter within the white matter of the spinal cord. These areas are most striking in the dorsal funiculus, with its highly ordered columns of myelinated axons, although they have also been observed in the ventral and lateral funiculi. They vary from focal regions within the white matter detectable only by elec-tron microscopy to large structures visible by light micros-copy Fig. 4A . High-magnification electron microscopy demonstrated the classic morphology of dendrite processes and axonal terminals, with synapses between the den-drites and axonal terminals clearly evident Fig. 4B,C . The incidence of gray matter invasion was low, with only 4 of 12 aged transgenic mice examined exhibiting aberrant neurite growth in the cervical spinal cord white matter. In most of the animals only the cervical spinal cord was sampled, so the incidence might have been higher if the entire CNS was examined. However, regions of aberrant gray matter in the dorsal funiculus were observed in both lines of DM20*ShP mice starting at 9 months of age, whereas they were never observed in age-matched wild-type mice 10 mice , nor were they observed in young DM20*ShP transgenic mice 10 mice between the ages of 3 weeks and 3 months or wild-type mice close to 100 mice examined over several studies . There has also been no evidence of such an abnormality in young dozens of mice 1â3 months of age or old five mice .8 months of age transgenic mice expressing wild-type PLP and DM20 transgenes, nor in young mice carrying mutations in the endogenous PLP gene dozens examined over the years . Gray matter invasion was most prominent in the oldest animal examined 20 months , which had foci of gray matter in the dorsal white matter, ventral white matter, and one lateral funiculus. However, the number of affected animals is too small to determine if there is progressive outgrowth of the gray matter with age or just variation between affected individuals. Evidence for cytotoxicity in the CNS of DM20*ShP transgenic mice Apoptotic cell death in the cervical spinal cord was demonstrated by the TUNEL method, quantitating cell death in nine sections from each of three DM20*ShP and two wild-type mice, aged 18â20 months. The results from each DM20*ShP mouse were analyzed against the pooled wild-type mice, because analysis of the two wild-type mice demonstrated that there was no significant difference between them. Two of three DM20*ShP transgenic mice had significantly increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the dorsal funiculus over that observed in the wild-type mice Fig. 5 P 5 0.0003 TG2 and P , 0.0001 TG3 by the unpaired t-test as compared to the pooled wild-type mice . Most of the apoptotic cells were scattered throughout the dorsal funiculus. Animal TG3, shown in Figure 4A, had a cluster of apoptotic cells along the tract of dendrite pro-cesses within the dorsal funiculus. TG3 also had lesions of gray matter in the ventral and lateral funiculi, and there was approximately a twofold increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the ventral funiculus of this animal. There was no significant increase in apoptotic cells in the gray matter of the dorsal horn in any of the transgenic animals. Immunocytochemical ICC staining was performed to investigate further the cellular events occurring in old DM20*ShP transgenic mice. All of the DM20*ShP mice had increased numbers of T cells and macrophages in the blood vessels and ventral fissure of the cervical spinal cord, regardless of whether they displayed aberrant dendrite growth. There were few T cells within white matter tissue of the cervical spinal cord, although aged wild-type mice had virtually no T cells within the tissue data not shown . The region of dendritic processes in the dorsal funiculus of TG3 had a particularly large concentration of ameboid macrophages, but there were numerous macrophages within all white matter funiculi in all DM20*ShP mice Fig. 6 . Combining TUNEL with staining with the MacI antibody on the same sections demonstrated clearly that the macrophages did not colocalize with the apoptotic cells. However, attempts to combine TUNEL and anti-PLP antibodies were unsuccessful, so it is not clear whether the apoptotic cells are oligodendroglia, neurons, or astroglia. ICC with an antibody that detects a nonphosphorylated epitope on neurofilaments common in neuronal degenera-tion SMI32 did not detect any difference in staining between wild-type and DM20*ShP transgenic mice. GFAP staining demonstrated that DM20*ShP mice exhibited focal tracts of astrocytic hypertrophy, which was not observed in any of the wild-type mice examined data not shown .

We have labelled neurons in the central body of the Australian freshwater crayfish Cherax destructor by the extracellular application of dextrans and by treating the brain with antibodies to anti-CCAP, anti-locustatachykinin, anti-perisulfakinin, anti-proctolin, anti-dip-allatostatin AI, anti-PEA-head-peptide, anti-serotonin, and anti-rabbit anti-substance P, all of which label neurons in the insect brain. The dextran and immunocytochemical labelling have revealed a neural complex associated with the crayfish central body that is very similar in overall anatomical architecture to the subset of neuropils that are incorporated in the central complex of the insects, and in particular to that of the locust. Similarities between the crayfish and locust central complexes extend to the number and position of the neuropils, the location of the cell body clusters of the neurons that belong to the central complex, the numbers of tracts that link some of the constituent neuropils together, and the form and immunoreactivity of many of the individual neuron classes. These similarities are taken as evidence to support a possible homology between the crustacean central complex and that of the insects.</AbstractText></Citation></Article>

Neurol. 416 30â44, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The role of dopamine DA in the basal ganglia and its contribution to motor and psychocognitive functioning has been under investigation for several decades. Loss of mesencephalic DA innervation to the caudate putamen is the primary cause of motor and cognitive decline in Parkinsonâs disease PD , whereas hyperactivity in limbic DA systems produces psychosis and may contribute to the symptomatology of schizophrenia Hornykiewicz, 1979 Snyder, 1982 . The DAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta SNC project to the striatum and release DA onto striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons to activate D1 and D2 receptors, respectively Robertson and Robertson, 1987 Gerfen et al., 1990 Graybiel, 1990, 1991 LeMoine et al., 1990, 1991 . Because DA D1 recep-tors D1R are coupled positively, whereas D2 receptors D2R are coupled negatively, to both adenylate cyclase and inositol phospholipid signaling pathways Kebabian and Calne, 1979 Stoof and Kebabian, 1981 Mahan et al., 1990 , stimulation of these receptors increases transmis-sion through direct striatal projections but decreases transmission through indirect striatal projections. In addi-tion to modulating efferent transmission from the stria-tum, DAergic neurons extend dendritic arborizations into the underlying substantia nigra pars reticulata SNR , where the release of DA regulates SNR activity Cheramy et al., 1981 Robertson, 1992 . Greater than 85% of neurons in the SNC are DAergic, whereas the remainder, known as secondary cells, are thought to be cholinergic or g-aminobutyric acidergic GABAergic Javoy-Agid et al., 1981 Lacey et al., 1989 . The function of these secondary cells remains unclear. Electrophysiological studies have revealed similarities between secondary neurons in the SNC and interneurons of other brain regions Miles and Wong, 1984 Madison and Nicoll, 1988 Lacey et al., 1989 Yung et al., 1991 . How-ever, van der Kooy et al. 1981 have shown that a small population of non-DAergic cells in the SNC sends projec-tions to the striatum, supporting the notion that secondary cells also may contribute to the regulation of the basal ganglia. In this report, we provide a novel description of a population of cells in the SNC, the activation of which appears to be correlated with changes in basal ganglia activity. These cells can be activated reliably by administra-tion of the psychostimulant drugs, d-amphetamine or apomorphine, and they are found consistently at the level of the interpeduncular nucleus but not always at other rostrocaudal levels of the SNC. The objectives of this study were to determine the neurochemical phenotype of these cells as well as to elucidate the mechanism by which they are activated. We also were interested in determining whether these cells projected rostrally to the striatum. To address these issues, we examined the effects of impaired basal ganglia circuitry on the stimulant-induced activa-tion of these SNC neurons. The expression of the immedi-ate-early gene, c-fos, was used to metabolically map the activation of cells in the SNC in response to direct apomor-phine and indirect d-amphetamine dopamine agonists. The effects of nigrostriatal DA depletion, using 6-hydroxy-dopamine 6-OHDA lesioning Ungerstedt, 1968 , were compared with those produced by direct suppression of striatal efferent transmission, using intracerebral infu-sions of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted to c-fos mRNA Chiasson et al., 1992, 1994 Dragunow et al., 1993, 1994 Heilig et al., 1993 Sommer et al., 1993 Hooper et al., 1994 Hebb and Robertson, 1997a,b . Previous studies have shown that infusion of anti-c-fos oligodeoxynucleo-tides into the striatum not only suppressed Fos induction in this region but also reduced the release of GABA from striatonigral terminals and increased the activation of neurons in the globus pallidus Sommer et al., 1996 Hebb and Robertson, 1997b . The latter effect was consistent with a reduction in inhibitory, GABAergic striatopallidal activity. Infusion of control oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect on either parameter. Thus, although the mechanism remains unclear, it appears that suppression of striatal c-fos induction effectively reduced the efferent transmis-sion from this region. We have used antisense oligodeoxy-nucleotides to alter striatal activity without interfering with DA transmission from the SNC. We provide a neuro-anatomic and neurochemical description of SNC neurons that are activated differentially after alterations in the striatum and the substantia nigra. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental design All experimental procedures were approved by the Ani-mal Care Committee at Dalhousie University. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 275â400 grams were used in this study. Surgery-naive animals were challenged with d-amphetamine n 5 8 . Also, two groups of animals received a unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway by using 6-OHDA and subsequently were challenged with d-amphetamine 6-OHDAamp group n 5 4 or apomor-phine 6-OHDAapo group n 5 5 . A fourth group of animals received a unilateral infusion of antisense oligode- oxynucleotides targeting c-fos mRNA into the striatum followed by administration of d-amphetamine ASF group n 5 5 . Surgical procedures All surgeries were performed under halothane-induced anesthesia with the animals mounted in a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus Kopf, Inc., Tujunga, CA . Both 6-OHDA and oligodeoxynucleotide infusions were performed by pres-sure injection by using a CMA 100 Carnegie-Medicin, Stockholm, Sweden microinjection pump with 25-gauge steel cannulae.All stereotaxic coordinates given are accord-ing to Paxinos and Watson 1997 . Animals that received 6-OHDA lesions were treated with desipramine 25 mg kg, i.p. 30 minutes prior to infusion of 6-OHDA 4 Î¼l of 12 mM solution at 0.5 Î¼l minute into the right medial forebrain bundle [coordinates from Bregma anteroposterior AP , 23.6 mm lateral LAT , 2.0 mm, dovsoventral DV . 28.8 mm . After infusion, the cannula was left in place for an additional 2 minutes to allow for diffusion away from the injection site. After surgery, the skin was sutured, and animals were left to recover for 3 days, 7 days, or 21 days. Animals that received postoperative recovery periods of 3 days and 7 days were used only to assess the rate of lesion progression Fos mapping and double-labeling studies were performed only in animals that had 21-day recovery periods. Animals in the ASF group received bilateral placement of cannulae into the striata coordinates from Bregma AP, 1.0 mm LAT, 63.0 mm DV, 26.0 mm . The right striatum was infused with anti-c-fos oligodeoxynucleotides 2 Î¼l of 1 mM solution at 0.25 Î¼l minute , whereas the left striatum received an equal volume of vehicle. After infusion, the cannulae were left in place for an additional 2 minutes to allow for diffusion away from the injection site. The skin was then sutured, and the animals were left to recover for 1 hour. This postoperative latency had been established previously as the period of optimal suppressive effects of ASF Hebb and Robertson, 1997a . Oligodeoxynucleotides Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Genosys Houston, TX and were single end capped sulfur modifica-tion on the phosphate group between the first and last base pairs . Briefly, standard phosphoramidite chemistry for oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis was used with samples of each synthesis examined on polyacrylamide gels to verify oligonucleotide quality. All oligodeoxynucleotides were ex-tracted and precipitated by the manufacturer to remove organics and salts prior to lyophilization. Oligodeoxy-nucleotides were reconstituted in ultrafiltered millipore distilled water at a concentration of 1 nmol Î¼l. The antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to c-fos mRNA, called ASF, was 15 bases in length and had been used previously in both partial and complete phosphorothioate forms Chi-asson et al., 1992, 1994 Dragunow et al., 1993 Heilig et al., 1993 Sommer et al., 1993, 1996 Hooper et al., 1994 Hebb and Robertson, 1997a,b, 1999a,b . Its sequence, 58-GsAA-CAT-CAT-GGT-CGsT-38, corresponded to bases 129â143 on the mRNA transcript GenBank accession no. XO6769 and spanned the initiation codon the subscript ââsââ denotes locations of the sulfur modifications . We have previously demonstrated the specificity of end-capped ASF in the striatum by the comparison of its suppressive actions with the effects of vehicle infusions and two distinct, random oligodeoxynucleotides Hebb and Robert-son, 1997a,b, 1999a . We and others also have demon-strated the specificity of the same oligodeoxynucleotide sequence in both partial and complete phosphorothioate forms by using mismatch and sense controls Chiasson et al., 1992 Heilig et al., 1993 Hooper et al., 1994 Sommer et al., 1996 . Unilateral infusions of control oligodeoxynucleo-tides random, sense, mismatch or vehicle into the stria-tum produced negligible suppression of stimulant-induced c-fos expression. Thus, the neurophysiological effects pres-ently described in the ASF group have been attributed to the specific inhibition of c-fos expression in the striatum and were not produced by nonspecific oligodeoxynucleotide or vehicle infusions. Immunohistochemistry After the appropriate recovery periods, animals were given intraperitoneal injections of either d-amphetamine 5 mg kg 6-OHDAamp and ASF groups or apomorphine 0.5 mg kg 6-OHDAapo group . Two hours after stimulant administration, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital .100 mg kg and perfused through the left ventricle, initially with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 M phosphate-buffer solution, pH 7.4. Brains were removed subsequently and postfixed at 4Â°C until further analysis. Brains were blocked, cut into 50-Î¼m coronal sections on a Vibratome, and subsequently processed for c-Fos, tyrosine hydroxylase TH , or glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD 67 kDa isoform GAD67 immu-noreactivity. For immunohistochemistry, the tissue was washed for 10 minutes in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 PBS-TX except for GAD immunoreactivity see below . This was followed by a 15-minute incubation in 1% hydrogen peroxide to inacti-vate endogenous peroxidase activity and three subsequent 10-minute washes in PBS-TX at room temperature. Sec-tions were then incubated in a solution containing a polyclonal antibody to c-Fos 1 5,000 Genosys , TH 1 4,000 Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR , or GAD67 1 5,000 Chemi-con, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada for 16â24 hours at 4Â°C. They were then washed three times for 10 minutes each in PBS-TX and incubated in a 1 500 dilution of an appropriate, biotinylated secondary antibody Vector Labo-ratories, Burlingame, CA for 1â2 hours at room tempera-ture. Excess antibody was removed by washing three times for 10 minutes each in PBS-TX, and the bound secondary was visualized by using the avidin-biotin com-plex ABC technique ABC Elite kit Vector Laboratories with diaminobenzidine DAB as the chromogen. We found that addition of detergents markedly reduced the GAD immunoreactivity in cell somata therefore, all immunohis-tochemical procedures using the GAD67 antibody were performed in solutions that did not contain Triton X-100. Processed sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, dehydrated in graded alcohols, delipidated in xylenes, and coverslipped. Some tissue sections were double labeled for Fos-like immunoreactivity -LI and GAD67 by using two-color DAB immunohistochemistry. Immunolabeling of these two proteins in the same tissue was technically challenging. Because the c-Fos antibody required the presence of Triton-X, whereas the GAD67 antibody required detergent-free PBS, simultaneous incubation in a PBS solution containing both c-Fos and GAD67 antibodies was not feasible. Therefore, we performed complete immunohisto-chemical reactions with the GAD67 antibody by using conventional brown DAB followed by immunohistochem-istry for c-Fos by using nickel-enhanced blue DAB, as described above. Fluorescent double labeling was performed with c-Fos TH and c-Fos GAD67 antibody combinations. All incu-bations were performed at 4Â°C. For the c-Fos TH combina-tion, sections were incubated in a buffer solution of PBS-TX that contained both primary antibodies at the dilutions described above. After a 24â48 hour incubation, the sec-tions were washed three times for 10 minutes each in PBS-TX and subsequently incubated in indocarobocya-nine-2 Cy2 -conjugated donkey anti-sheep c-Fos and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit TH antibodies at a dilution of 1 400 BIO CAN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada for 16â24 hours. Excess antibody was removed by washing three times for 10 each minutes in PBS-TX. The sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated slides and visualized using filter sets to detect Cy2 catalogue no.487710 Zeiss, Thorwood, NY and Cy3 catalog no. 487715 Zeiss immu-nofluorescence. For the c-Fos GAD67 antibody combination, the sections initially were incubated in a PBS without TX solution containing the GAD67 antibody for 16â24 hours. They were then washed three times for 10 minutes each in PBS and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, as described above. Sections subsequently were washed and incubated in a PBS-TX solution containing the c-Fos antibody for 16â24 hours. After rinsing, the tissue was incubated with a Cy2-conjugated anti-sheep antibody in PBS-TX for 16â24 hours. After the removal of excess antibody, the fluorochromes were viewed as described above. Selected sections also were stained for Nissl substance. Briefly, 50-Î¼m sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, dehydrated in graded alcohols and xy-lenes, rehydrated, and stained with 0.1% cresyl violet. Retrograde labeling of SNC neurons To determine whether the Fos-positive cells that were identified in the SNC projected to the striatum, retrograde labeling of nigrostriatal neurons was combined with c-Fos immunofluorescence. Two naive animals were subjected to stereotaxic surgery, as described above, in which a single 25-gauge cannula was inserted into the right striatum coordinates from Bregma AP, 1.0 mm LAT 13.0 mm DV, 26.0 mm , and 0.5 Î¼l of 4% FluoroGold Fluorochrome Inc., Englewood, CO solution was infused at a rate of 0.1 Î¼l minute. After infusion, the cannula was retracted, the skin was sutured, and the animals were left to recover for 5 days. After this time, the animals received 5 mg kg d-amphetamine i.p. and were placed in their cages for 2 hours, after which they were anesthetized and perfused as described above. Sections were cut through the SNC, and the tissue was processed for c-Fos immunofluorescence, as described above. FluoroGold fluoresced optimally under a wide-band ultraviolet filter. However, because both Fluoro-Gold and the Cy2 fluorochrome fluoresced under the Zeiss Cy2 filter, we used a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody to visualize the c-Fos immunolabeling. There was no overlap between the emission wavelengths for FluoroGold and the Cy3-conjugated antibody. Quantification of Fos-positive nuclei in the SNC Sections were collected through the SNC of all animals and processed for Fos-LI, as described above. After immu-nohistochemistry, duplicate sections were obtained from the SNC of each animal at the level of the interpeduncular nucleus and were scanned into a computer using a CCD camera JVC, Tokyo, Japan to create digital images. By using NIH densitometry software NIH, Bethesda, MD , both the ipsilateral and contralateral SNC were isolated in their entire cross section, and the number of Fos-positive nuclei per area was calculated. Any degree of nuclear Fos labeling within a cell that was visible under a light microscope qualified that cell as Fos-positive. The thresh-old of the NIH densitometry software was set to include all visible nuclei. The number of Fos-positive nuclei per cross-sectional area in each animal was calculated as the mean of the two sample values. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for the ipsilateral and contralat-eral SNC of all experimental groups. Within groups, these values were subjected to a Studentâs paired t-test to determine whether there were significant differences in the Fos-LI between the ipsilateral SNC and the contralat-eral SNC. Significance was assumed at P , 0.05. Computer-generated photomicrographs were assembled into figures for publication by using Adobe Photoshop version 4.0 Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA with minimal alter-ations to the contrast and background. The regions shown in the figures represent the areas from which cell counts were obtained. DISCUSSION In this report, we describe the activation of a population of neurons in the SNC by the DA agonists, d-amphetamine and apomorphine, in intact, 6-OHDA-lesioned, and ASF-infused animals. Nuclear expression of Fos-LI in the SNC was not present in TH-positive cells but was colocalized with cytoplasmic GAD, indicating that these neurons were GABAergic. In all groups, elimination of the stimulant-induced Fos-LI corresponded to a reduced expression of c-fos in the striatum, suggesting that efferent striatal transmission had mediated the SNC response. Because DA neurons of the SNC are active tonically, it is believed that the release of DAinto the striatum maintains a resting tone that can be modulated by changes in nigral activity Lacey et al., 1989 Yung et al., 1991 . Also, dendritic release of DA into the underlying SNR has been shown to facilitate efferent transmission from this region and attenuate the inhibitory effects of GABA Ruffieux and Schultz, 1980 Waszczak and Walters, 1983 Martin and Waszczak, 1996 . Thus, the effects of DA in the striatum and in the SNR appear to counteract one another, increas-ing inhibitory tone to the SNR via activation of direct striatonigral transmission and facilitating SNR activity, respectively. It is possible that the extent to which each of these components affects SNR output is reflected by the level of stimulation of SNC neurons. Although DA regulates the activity of neurons in the striatum and SNR, stimulation of either of these regions markedly suppresses neuronal activity in the SNC Dray et al., 1976 Gerfen, 1984 Jimenez-Castellanos and Gray-biel, 1989 Tepper et al., 1995 . For example, Tepper et al. 1995 used antidromic stimulation of SNR neurons while simultaneously recording from the SNC to show that increases in reticulata firing rates were associated with decreased SNC activity. The physiologic role of SNR-SNC interactions remains unclear. One possibility is that this circuit provides a positive feed-back mechanism by which increased SNR activity reduces nigrostriatal DAergic trans-mission and, subsequently, decreases the inhibitory input to the SNR from the striatum. Alternatively, increased suppression of DAergic neurons in the SNC would reduce the dendritic release of DA onto SNR terminals and decrease the facilitory influence of DA on reticulata out-flow. This paradoxical influence of reduced SNC tone on SNR activity may be dependent on the degree of reticulata stimulation. For example, low-level SNC inhibition may result only in a decrease of dendritic DA release, increas-ing inhibitory tone to the SNR. Such localized inhibition may act as a physiologic barrier that prevents the transmis-sion of unwanted signals from the SNR to downstream nuclei. Marked increases in SNR activity may overcome this threshold and potentiate SNR output by reducing the release of DA into the striatum and decreasing D1R-mediated striatonigral transmission. Although the majority of studies that have investigated the SNC have focused on the neurophysiology of DAergic neurons in this region, several electrophysiological and immunocytochemical studies have described at least two types of SNC neurons Javoy-Agid et al., 1981 van der Kooy et al., 1981 Lacey et al., 1989 Yung et al., 1991 . Lacey et al. 1989 described two classes of neurons in the SNC that were distinguished on the basis of their electro-physiological properties. They found that 95% of SNC neurons, which they termed ââprincipal neurons,ââ had spontaneous, low-frequency action potentials of relatively long duration. These neurons were inhibited significantly by DA or baclofen a GABA agonist . In contrast, the remaining 5% of neurons called ââsecondary cellsââ exhib-ited rapid, high-frequency action potentials that were unaffected by DA but were inhibited by baclofen. Yung et al. 1991 also described two populations of SNC neurons that were distinguished by their electrophysiological mem-brane properties. Consistent with previous reports, those authors classified these cells as either bursting 15% of total cells or nonbursting 85% of total cells . Double-labeling experiments revealed that all of the nonbursting cells were positive for TH immunoreactivity and, thus, were assumed to be DA neurons. None of the bursting cells were TH-positive, and their distribution paralleled that of GAD-positive cells in the SNC. A similar abundance of GAD immunoreactivity in this region was reported previ-ously by Oertel et al. 1982 . Yung and colleagues 1991 suggested that these burster cells were GABAergic neu-rons and may represent a component of the non-DAergic nigrostriatal pathway implicated in previous anatomic van der Kooy et al., 1981 and electrophysiological Guy-enet and Aghajanian, 1978 studies. Consistent with the description of secondary cells in the SNC Lacey et al., 1989 , it was found that the burster cells in this region also were DA-insensitive Yung et al., 1991 . Striatonigral neurons that project to the SNC are local-ized predominantly to the striosomal compartment of the striatum and are stimulated by D1R activation Graybiel et al., 1990 . The stereotypic effects of d-amphetamine also are mediated primarily through D1R activation conse-quently, the Fos-LI that is induced in the striatum is confined mainly to striosomes Graybiel et al., 1990 . However, there also is substantial D1-mediated stimula-tion after d-amphetamine challenge of striatal neurons that project to the SNR. In the present study, administra-tion of d-amphetamine consistently induced Fos-LI in TH-negative, GAD-positive neurons of the central region of the SNC. The mechanism by which d-amphetamine induced Fos-LI in the SNC remains unclear. However, the ipsilateral elimination of this expression in animals that had received either a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion or an intrastriatal infusion of ASF indicated that striatal activa-tion was necessary for the SNC response to these stimu-lants. Also, because striatal projection neurons are GABAergic, the stimulation of the SNC must have been produced indirectly through secondary circuits. Results obtained from the 6-OHDAamp and ASF groups suggested two possible mechanisms of SNC stimulation. The first possibility hypothesis 1 is that, in naive animals, DA acts in the SNC to tonically inhibit activation of the GABAergic neurons, i.e., by D2R stimulation. Because d-amphet-amine increases the inhibitory input to the SNC from the striatum, this influence effectively would reduce the DA-mediated inhibition of GABAergic neurons. Ablation of DAergic neurons by 6-OHDA would remove permanently the inhibition of GABAergic transmission in the SNC, disregulating the activity of these neurons. Because c-Fos is induced in response to changes in neuronal activity, no expression would be observed in these cells that had been rendered tonically active. However, even if the DAergic neurons had remained intact, a similar reduction in stria-tonigral transmission, produced by an alternate mecha-nism, would be expected to suppress the stimulation of the GABAergic neurons in the SNC by disinhibition of DA activity . This was confirmed in the ASF group, in which nigrostriatal DA systems remained intact, and only effer-ent transmission from the striatum was affected. The second possibility hypothesis 2 predicts that the GABAergic neurons of the SNC are regulated by GABA- ergic influences from the SNR. This notion is supported by previous studies that demonstrated that SNR activity inhibits activity of the SNC Tepper et al., 1995 . Thus, in naive animals, administration of d-amphetamine in-creases the inhibition of the SNR via striatonigral stimula-tion, which reduces the inhibitory tone of the SNR on the SNC, permitting induction of Fos-LI in the SNC. In both the 6-OHDAamp group and the ASF group, the striatoni-gral influence was reduced drastically in the ipsilateral hemisphere , increasing both SNR outflow and inhibitory tone to the SNC. This second hypothesis is supported further by the previous report that 6-OHDAamp animals have a significant increase in Fos-LI in the ipsilateral SNR with a concurrent elimination of the expression in the SNC Hebb and Robertson, 1999c . Expression of Fos-LI in the SNC of 6-OHDAapo animals conflicted with the notion of DA-mediated regulation of GABAergic neurons hypothesis 1 and further supported the possibility that these cells in the SNC were influenced by SNR activity hypothesis 2 . For example, although it is possible that apomorphine acted directly at DA receptors in the SNC to induce Fos-LI, this notion contradicts hypothesis 1, which predicts that DA produces inhibition of these neurons. Furthermore, regions like the striatum that are subjected to tonic DA influence develop supersen-sitivity to direct DA agonists after depletion of endogenous sources Ungerstedt, 1971 . This phenomenon also has been observed in both the SNR and the entopeduncular nucleus in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals Hebb and Robert-son, 1999c . Therefore, if the GABAergic neurons in the SNC were directly influenced by DA, then it would be expected that a certain degree of sensitization would occur after DA depletion. However, there was no evidence to support this in the current studies. Hypothesis 2, however, was supported by the robust expression of Fos-LI in the ipsilateral striatum, but not the contralateral striatum, of 6-OHDAapo animals. This was consistent with the previ-ous observation that induction of Fos-LI in the SNC paralleled that in the striatum. These animals also exhib-ited an increase in Fos-LI in the contralateral SNR with no expression in the contralateral SNC. Thus, it appeared that, as in the other animal groups, SNC stimulation was mediated by increased striatonigral activity and a reduc-tion in SNR inhibition of the GABAergic neurons in the In their discussion of burster neurons in the SNC, Yung et al. 1991 suggested that these cells may comprise a GABAergic nigrostriatal pathway. From the similarities in electrophysiological properties, the abundance and loca-tion between burster neurons and the ââsecondary cellsââ described previously by Lacey et al. 1989 , those authors concluded that they belonged to the same neuronal sub-population. More recently, Rodriguez and Gonzalez-Hernandez 1999 used immunohistochemistry combined with cellular tracing and electrophysiology to characterize a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, unlike the present findings, the cell somata in the former study never were found in the SNC and could be filled retrogradely with a tracer that was applied to the striatum. Because the Fos-positive cells identified here were found consistently in the midst of retrogradely-labeled neurons but were not labeled them-selves, it is unlikely that these cells projected to the striatum but failed to take up the cellular tracer. It appears, therefore, that the GABAergic cells in this study are distinct from those characterized by Rodriguez and Gonzalez-Hernandez 1999 . However, the location and abundance of the Fos-positive, GABAergic neurons in the SNC are consistent with earlier reports and suggest that these cells are burster secondary neurons Lacey et al., 1989 Yung et al., 1991 . Also, the demonstration that the burster cells are insensitive to DA but are inhibited markedly by GABA agonists further supports the hypoth-esis that these cells are regulated through SNR transmis-sion and not directly by DAergic colaterals hypothesis 2 . The GABAergic neurons in the SNC that were identified in this study do not appear to comprise a non-DAergic, nigrostriatal circuit. Retrograde labeling with FluoroGold produced an abundance of filled neurons throughout the entire extent of the SNC. We did not observe any cells in this region that were double labeled for Fos-LI and Fluoro-Gold. In fact, the distribution of the Fos-positive nuclei among the large, FluoroGold-filled neurons was similar to that observed with double immunofluorescence for Fos and TH. Together with the previously reported similarities between secondary neurons and interneurons of other brain regions Miles and Wong, 1984 Madison and Nicoll, 1988 Lacey et al., 1989 Yung et al., 1991 , these results suggest that the Fos-positive, GABAergic neurons re-ported in this study may belong to a class of interneurons. The activation of these cells by DA agonists suggests that they may play a role in inhibitory mechanisms that reduce the DAergic stimulation of striatal neurons. Whether these neurons project to the SNR or only arborize locally remains unknown. However, results from studies that demonstrated a reciprocal relation between SNR activity and SNC activity argue against a GABAergic interneuro-nal connection between these two regions Grace and Bunney, 1979 Waszczak et al., 1980 . Determination of the mechanism of stimulation and the function of these GABAergic neurons will require electrophysiological meth-ods and may provide insight into regulatory processes that exist between the SNC, the SNR, and the basal ganglia. RESULTS Extent of 6-OHDA lesions and ASF-induced c-Fos suppression TH immunoreactivity. Examination of TH immunore-activity after various postlesion recovery periods revealed a progressive deterioration of DA cells in the substantia nigra. Three days after infusion of 6-OHDAinto the medial forebrain bundle, there was substantial loss of TH-positive dendritic processes and an overall reduction in the number of TH-positive cell bodies in the SNC Fig. 1A,B . After 1 week, TH immunoreactivity revealed extensive pyknosis in the SNC. At this time point, all evidence of dendritic arborization was lost, and the SNC appeared as a strip of densely clustered granules Fig. 1C,D . By 3 weeks after 6-OHDA infusion, there remained only scant traces of TH immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra, indicating a near total destruction of DAergic cells Fig. 1E,F . Nissl staining. Nissl staining of lesioned animals with 3-week recovery periods revealed extensive loss of large-diameter somata in the SNC Fig. 1G,H . This confirmed that, at 3 weeks after 6-OHDAlesioning, the DA cells of the SNC were destroyed and did not merely reflect a suppression of TH expression. All of the 6-OHDA-lesioned animals used in subsequent analyses were exam-ined at this time point. Fos immunoreactivity. Infusion of ASF reduced the induction of Fos-LI in the striatum by approximately 65% data not shown . Effective ASF-mediated suppression of c-fos expression in this region has been described previ-ously Hebb and Robertson 1997a, 1999a,c . Examination of Fos-LI in striata of 6-OHDAamp ani-mals also revealed a significant reduction in expression on the ipsilateral side. In contrast, 6-OHDAapo animals had robust Fos-LI in the ipsilateral striatum but negligible induction on the contralateral side. The effects of 6-OHDA lesioning on stimulant-induced c-Fos expression in the striatum were consistent with those reported previously Cenci et al., 1992 Hebb and Robertson, 1999c . Differential expression of c-fos in the SNC In naive animals, d-amphetamine 5 mg kg induced bilateral expression of Fos-LI in the central region of the SNC at the level of the interpeduncular nucleus Fig. 2AâC . Animals that received a 6-OHDA lesion followed by apomorphine challenge had a significant reduction of this expression in the contralateral SNC, with robust induction on the ipsilateral side number of Fos-positive cells ipsilat-eral, 41.3 6 9.8 contralateral, 11.9 6 1.6 P 5 0.035 Fig. 2DâF . In contrast, the 6-OHDAamp ipsilateral, 6.0 6 1.3 contralateral, 27.0 6 0.96 P , 0.001 Fig. 3AâC and ASF groups ipsilateral, 18.3 6 5.9 contralateral, 35.3 6 9.2 P 5 0.027 Fig. 3DâF had a near complete elimination of Fos-LI in the ipsilateral SNC, with normal induction on the contralateral side. The results of the quantification of Fos expression in the SNC of the experimental groups are illustrated in Figure 4. Characterization of Fos-positive cells in the SNC phine-induced Fos-LI in 6-OHDA-lesioned SNC, which exhibited no TH immunoreactivity, indicated that the Fos-positive cells were not DA neurons. However, to con-firm this hypothesis, we used double-labeling immunofluo-rescence for Fos-LI and TH in naive animals that had been challenged with d-amphetamine. The Fos-positive nuclei were interspersed between large TH-containing neurons, but the two antigens were never colocalized in the same cells Fig. 5A,B . Also, to confirm that Fos induction was not altered in the SNC after ablation of the DAergic neurons of this region, similar double-labeling experi-ments were performed on 6-OHDAapo animals. Although the TH immunolabeling was eliminated in these animals, apomorphine still produced robust induction of Fos-LI in the lesioned SNC Fig. 5C,D . ports have described the distribution of GAD-positive neurons in the SNC Oertel et al., 1982 Yung et al., 1991 . We were interested in determining whether the Fos-positive cells in the SNC also expressed GAD, indicating a GABAergic phenotype. We initially performed conven-tional DAB immunohistochemistry for Fos or GAD by using serial sections through the SNC. Because the Fos antibody worked poorly on 14-Î¼m-thick, slide-mounted sections not shown , it was necessary to use 50-Î¼m-thick, free-floating sections. This method revealed a high concen-tration of GAD-positive cell bodies in the vicinity of the Fos-positive nuclei Fig. 6 . To confirm Fos and GAD colocalization, we next per-formed sequential, two-color DAB immunohistochemistry. This technique revealed several double-labeled neurons in the SNC, confirming our hypothesis that the Fos-express-ing cells were GABAergic Fig. 7 . Sequential immunofluo-rescent double labeling of Fos and GAD also demonstrated colocalization of these proteins Fig. 8 . Retrograde labeling and Fos immunofluorescence. Five days after tracer injection, the FluoroGold had dif-fused throughout a substantial portion of the striatum. The fluorescence was confined within the striatum, except for a small region of diffusion through the cannulae tract into the overlying cortex Fig. 9A .At this time point, there was extensive retrograde labeling of cells in the SNC, producing a pattern of fluorescence similar to that seen with TH immunofluorescence in naive animals Fig. 9B compare with Fig. 5A . Subsequent immunohistochemis-try revealed that the Fos-positive nuclei in the SNC were not contained within FluoroGold-labeled neurons but were interspersed between these cells Fig. 5E,F .

Neurol. 416 224â244, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Current concepts of the processing of sensory informa-tion and the generation of motor patterns by the mamma-lian cerebral cortex rely on the identification of anatomical subdivisions. Comparative analysis shows that it is pos-sible to recognize homologous cortical regions areas and modules in several mammalian groups, allowing the proposal of hypotheses on the evolution of the cerebral cortex and, consequently, general principles underlying its organization Kaas, 1987, 1989b Krubitzer, 1995 North-cutt and Kaas, 1995 . With respect to the visual cortex, the most accepted model of organization presumes that, in most mammals, it includes a common primary visual area V1 or striate cortex ST bordered anteriorly or laterally by a single belt, the second visual area V2 . It has been proposed that at least these two fields would have been present in a common ancestor living in the Cretaceous period, 145â165 million years ago Northcutt and Kaas, 1995 . One important aspect of this arrangement, as it is observed in many mammals, is that at least V2 is not homogeneous but parceled out in groups of cortical mod-ules Kaas and Krubitzer, 1991 Krubitzer, 1995 . In primates, these compartments appear to handle distinct information, segregating specific attributes of the visual scene to specialized neural circuits Maunsell, 1992 Van Essen and DeYoe, 1995 . By analogy, some authors have suggested that the existence of anatomical heterogeneities reported in V2 of mammals like squirrels Kaas et al., 1989 and tree shrews Sesma et al., 1984 would corre-spond also to functional specializations, reflecting a gen-eral plan of sensory processing in the visual cortex. However, a different organization has been proposed for the visual cortex of some rodents, including the rat, mouse, and hamster Montero, 1981, 1993 OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Mon-tero, 1981, 1984, 1989, 1990 Bravo et al., 1990a Sereno and Allman, 1991 Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993 . Accord-ing to this view, in these and other species, a mosaic of retinotopically organized small areas borders V1. In the rat, at least seven visual areas have been identified adjacent to V1 on the basis of physiological or hodological criteria Montero et al., 1973a,b Montero, 1981, 1993 OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Montero, 1981, 1984, 1989, 1990 Espinosa and Thomas, 1983 Thomas and Espinosa, 1987 Sander-son et al., 1991 Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993 Orbach and Van Essen, 1993 . Among their anatomic features, these extrastriate areas appear to be bordered by callosal connec-tions that contain a representation of the vertical meridian Espinosa and Thomas, 1983 OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Montero, 1984 and exhibit separate connections with V1 Montero et al., 1973b OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Montero, 1981 Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993 Montero, 1993 and the superior collicu-lus OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Van Sluyters, 1982 . Additional adjoin- ing fields have been distinguished, and a suggestion has been made that all of these areas constitute a processing system that exhibits features also found in advanced mammals, i.e., specialization, hierarchy, and distribution of information in processing streams Coogan and Burkhal-ter, 1993 Montero, 1993 . A question that emerges is how the two different organi-zations of the peristriate visual cortex described above arose during evolution. Assuming as original the existence of V2, the rat condition would represent a derived one the set of areas adjoining V1 in some rodents may have evolved from the constituent modules of V2 present in an ancestral form. However, the opposite alternative has been proposed by Montero 1981, 1993 , i.e., that the âârodent planââ is primitive and would be present in all the rodent groups, including squirrels Montero and Murphy, 1976 , as well as in lagomorphs Montero and Cliffer, 1981 see also OlavarrÄ± Â´a et al., 1987 Mu Â¨ller-Paschinger and To Â¨mboÂ¨l, 1989 Sereno and Allman, 1991 . Furthermore, it has been claimed that V2 of other mammals would be homologous to one of the small areas present in the extrastriate rat visual cortex, namely, the lateromedial area LM Montero, 1993 . The study of the cortical organization of opossums, the American marsupials classified in the Didelphidae family, could shed some light on this controversy, because they are supposed to conserve many neural features of the first mammals and, thus, reflect the primitive condition Ebner, 1969 Lende, 1969 Kirsch and Johnson, 1983 Jerison, 1990 . Benevento and Ebner 1971 , on the basis of pat-terns of thalamocortical, striate-peristriate, and interhemi-spheric projections, originally reported that the peristriate cortex PS of the North American opossum, Didelphis virginiana, contained cortical belts homologous to areas 18 and 19 of other mammals. However, Bravo et al. 1990b , using a similar hodological approach, suggested later that, in the mouse opossum, Marmosa elegans, PS contained a set of areas resembling the rat mosaic of visual fields. Indeed, OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Van Sluyters 1995 have also assumed that peristriate commissural stripes or bridges perpendicular to the anterolateral limit of V1 correspond in marsupials to borders of multiple areas similar to those of some rodents. The discrepancy arises from the fact that the periodical heterogeneities observed in the interhemi-spheric and striate-peristriate patterns in Didelphis as well as in Marmosa could conform either to the existence of modules of a single V2 adjoining V1 or to the presence of a mosaic of multiple peristriate areas. Moreover, in the physiological studies from which the existence of V2 in Didel-phishasbeenproposed Sousaetal.,1978 Kaas,1980 Becket al., 1996 , in addition to anatomical observations, the record-ings may not have been sufficiently close to detect the hypo-thetical existence of small-sized areas bordering V1. In the current study, we have addressed the issue of the PS subdivisions of the didelphidean cortex by complement-ing the corticocortical and commissural hodology with the analysis of the corticotectal projections in the South Ameri-can opossum, Didelphis aurita, labeled after retrograde transport of tracers from the superior colliculus SC to PS or after anterograde transport from PS to SC. Discontinui-ties in this distribution in other mammals have been attributed to the presence of distinct areas OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Van Sluyters, 1982 Huerta and Harting, 1984 . The pattern of metabolic activity revealed by the histochemis-try for cytochrome oxidase CO was used as additional criterion for identifying cortical specializations. Moreover, the analysis of commissural and corticocortical patterns allowed us also to make suggestions on how the processing of information takes place in the opossum visual cortex. Finally, following our goal of defining visual related fields, we paid attention to nonsensory tectopetal cortical do-mains to test the hypothesis that the orbital cortex is involved in the control of ocular movements Lende, 1963b Martin, 1968 and should be considered, therefore, homolo-gous to the frontal eye field of other mammals in which direct projections to collicular layers have been docu-mented rat Leichnetz et al., 1987 cat Olson and Jeffers, 1987 macaque Stanton et al., 1988 . Our results suggest that the anterolateral portion of the opossum PS contains one or more areas successively concentric with V1 subdi-vided along the mediolateral axis in compartments that resemble the functional peristriate modules of more special-ized mammals. Evidence is presented for an additional posterolateral area caudal to the temporal cortex. Some of our results have been briefly presented elsewhere Martinich et al., 1990, 1992 Martinich and Rocha-Miranda, 1993 . MATERIALS AND METHODS The results described here were obtained from 15 adult opossums D. aurita that were either captured in urban areas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, or bred in our animal facilities. All of the procedures undertaken were in accor-dance with the principles of laboratory animal care stated by the National Institutes of Health and to regulations of the Brazilian Society for Neuroscience and Behavior for animal research. Collicular injections of neural tracers [wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase WGA-HRP or the fluorescent dyes Fast blue FB and Diamidino yellow DY ] were made in five animals for the analysis of corticotectal projections after retrograde transport. One animal that received an injection into PS with WGA-HRP was used for the analysis of corticotectal relations after anterograde transport to SC, as well as for the study of corticocortical connections. The corticocortical hodology also was studied after retrograde and anterograde trans-port in one animal that received an injection of WGA-HRP into ST and in two animals that received injections of fluorescent tracers rhodamine isothiocyanate [RITC], FB, and DY into ST and into PS. In addition, anterograde and retrograde transport revealed after massive injections of HRP into one hemisphere were studied in two animals for establishing the commissural pattern. The animals and injections used for labeling connectional patterns are listed in Table 1. Tracer injections For the study of neural connections, surgical procedures were conducted under anesthesia induced by intraperito-neal doses of Saffan alphaxalone alphadolone 24 mg kg Pittman-Moore, Inc., Mundelein, IL or pentobarbital 40 mg kg . Intramuscular injections of dexamethasone 1 mg kg and atropine 100 Î¼g kg were applied for the prevention of edema and bronchial secretion. A cannula was inserted endotracheally for artificial ventilation in case of respiratory arrest. The animalâs head was held in a stereotaxic frame. During surgery, which involved crani-otomy and durotomy, body temperature was maintained near the normal value of 34Â°C by using a thermocontrolled pad, and the heart rate was monitored to follow the level of anesthesia. Intraperitoneal Saffan or pentobarbital were supplemented as needed. With one exception see below , the injections of tracers were made by pressure through glass micropipettes coupled to Hamilton syringes of 1â5 Î¼l Hamilton, Reno, NV . The volumes employed for each tracer in single injections were as follows 0.05â0.1 Î¼l WGA-HRP 3% in saline Sigma, St. Louis, MO , 0.4â0.6 Î¼l fluorescent tracers FB, DY, and RITC 2% in distilled water Sigma , and 0.2 Î¼l HRP 10% in saline containing dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] 1% Sigma . For the study of corticotectal patterns of connections, single injections of WGA-HRP or FB were made into the SC of three animals, and two other animals received paired collicular injections of FB and DY. In four of the animals that received injections into the SC, the injection sites were determined under direct inspection after gently pushing aside the ipsilateral hemisphere. In one additional case, the injec-tion site was established by recording visual tectal activity through a transcortical microelectrode attached to a fine guide tube during standard electrophysiological proce-dures Volchan et al., 1978 . In that case, the collicular injection was made through the needle of a Hamilton syringe inserted into the guide tube. For the analysis of corticocortical connections by using WGA-HRP, the tracer was injected into ST in one animal. In addition, three fluorescent tracers were injected separately into single sites within ST in one animal, and separate injections of two tracers were made into PS in another case. The commissural pattern was studied after massive, unilateral injections of HRP into 20â30 sites distributed within the parietooccipital region. In all of the cases, after the end of the injections, the brain was covered by the remaining dura mater and gelfoam, and the cranial muscles and skin were sutured. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G 50.000 units kg was administered and the animals were allowed to recover. Histological analysis After an appropriate survival time 2â3 days for WGA-HRP and HRP and 12â18 days for fluorescent tracers , the animals were killed with a lethal dose of pentobarbital and perfused through the aorta with saline, 3% paraformalde-hyde in buffered phosphate, and, successively, 5%, 10%, and 15% buffered sucrose solutions for cryoprotection. For the study of horizontal cortical patterns, the brains were removed, and the isocortices were separated. For better flattening, the medial cingulate cortex was discarded. The isocortices were flattened between two glass slides OlavarrÄ± Â´a and Montero, 1984 , frozen with dry ice, and cut into horizontal sections 40 Î¼m in a cryostat. The hemi-sphere of one animal was cut into parasagittal sections 40 Î¼m for examining the laminar distribution of commis-sural connections. Sections from animals injected with HRP or WGA-HRP were processed by HRP histochemistry for revealing terminals and cell bodies using tetramethyl-benzidine as a chromogen Mesulam, 1978 . Unstained sections from animals injected with fluorescent tracers were mounted for inspection of retrograde labeling under epifluorescence illumination in a Zeiss Axioplan micro-scope Carl Zeiss, Germany using ultraviolet FB and DY or rhodamine RITC filters. Some regional borders were determined in selected sections by using as criteria the pattern of CO activity Wong-Riley, 1979 , or the density of myelin in stained sections Gallyas, 1979 or unstained sections Malach, 1989 , as well as by reference to the shallow sulci present in the more superficial sections. Section contours and labeled cells were digitized with the aid of a computer program coupled to the motorized stage of the microscope. The labeling shown in the results derives from the superposition of several plotted sections that were 80 Î¼m apart SC-injected animals or 120 Î¼m apart cerebral cortex-injected animals . In addition, archi-tectonic patterns were analyzed in the brains of four noninjected animals sectioned in coronal, parasagittal, or horizontal flattened cortices planes, paying special atten-tion to the localization of cortical sulci. Labeling in the brainstem and the diencephalon was analyzed in coronal sections 50 Î¼m . Sections processed for histochemical procedures were photographed in a Zeiss Axioplan micro-scope or in a Zeiss Stemi stereomicroscope, and prints were obtained on photographic paper. The photomicro-graphs were digitized by using a Genius Color-EP KYE System Corp. scanner and Photoshop software version 4.0 Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA to adjust the brightness and contrast of the images as a whole and to trim external contours. No other modifications of the images were intro-duced. In one case interhemispheric pattern , the final figure corresponded to a montage of six photomicrographs that were captured in Photoshop. RESULTS Delimitation of the peristriate cortex The opossum isocortex is considered to be lissencephalic however, in all of the brains examined, it was possible to distinguish the orbital and peristriate sulci Sor and Sps, respectively . The latter was coincident with the ST-PS border Sousa and Oswaldo-Cruz, 1978 . In many animals, especially the older ones, other, less distinct neocortical folds with constant localization also were visible here, they are called the temporal, parietomarginal, anterior peristriate, and posterolateral sulci. Figure 1B shows these landmarks in a tangential section stained with neutral red. The temporal sulcus Stm , the caudal ex-treme of which appeared to run up to the periphery of the isocortex in sections more superficial to the section shown in Figure 1B, was coincident with the internal border of the temporal cortex TM . Although it was not defined explicitly in the Virginia opossum, the presence of Stm was ascertained as a distinct cortical dip matching the transi-tion cortex between TM and PS Benevento and Ebner, 1971 , a region that is part of a cortical strip termed the transitional TM TMtr in the current study. The parieto-marginal sulcus Spm delimited the lateral border of the paramarginal cortex PM . The anterior peristriate sulcus Spsa delineated a curve nearly parallel to Sps. The posterolateral sulcus Spl ran between the caudal portion of Stm and the lateral extremity of Sps. In Figure 1C,D, some of these sulci can be observed, respectively, in a parasagittal section processed for acetylcholinesterase ACHE and in a coronal section stained for myelin. In this study, all of these sulci came to be considered reference points for delimiting cortical fields, an architectonic ap-proach that proved to be useful for the analysis of tangen-tial sections of flattened cortices, particularly those with-out well-defined CO patterns. The possibility that sulci can be correlated with borders of cortical domains Welker, 1990 also has been ascertained in someAustralian marsu-pials in morphofunctional studies Haight and Weller, 1973 Haight and Neylon, 1978, 1981 see also Haight and Murray, 1981 . As a working hypothesis, we assumed that the limits of PS with parietal cortex PA matched Spsa. In the illustrated sections, PS extended 4â5 mm from Sps along the anterolateral axis. A PS portion posterior to TM and medial to the rhinal fissure appeared lateral to Spl. This region, which represented approximately 20% of the total PS surface, has been defined previously in D. virgin-iana as the posterolateral peristriate area PSpl Ben-evento and Ebner, 1971 on the basis of cytoarchitectonics and thalamocortical patterns as well as the caudotemporal region CT in both D. virginiana Beck et al., 1996 and the short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica Kru-bitzer et al., 1997 on the basis of myeloarchitectonics. The metabolic activity in PS appeared less intense than in neighboring regions in sections processed for CO histo-chemistry Fig. 2A . It is noteworthy that the CO pattern in some animals was not homogeneous in PSal along the mediolateral axis, revealing alternating bands of high and moderate metabolic activity in its more caudal portion. These bands were oriented nearly perpendicular to the anterior ST limit with spacing of about 2 mm. Sections parallel to the ST border showed that the bands extended through all the cortical thickness except in layer I Fig. 2B . This periodic pattern resembles the patterns de-scribed in several mammals, including the gray squirrel Kaas et al., 1989 , the tree shrew Sesma et al., 1984 Cusick et al., 1985 , and primates Livingstone and Hubel, 1982 Tootell et al., 1983 Gattass et al., 1990 Kaas and Krubitzer, 1991 . In our hands, discontinuities in the myeloarchitectonic pattern were not as evident as those revealed with CO histochemistry. Nevertheless, when they were apparent, dense myelin bands matched high-level CO bands. Corticotectal connections Figure 3 shows the labeling obtained in the cortex of animals that received injections into SC. The visuotopic representation of the visual hemifield in SC and ST is schematized according to the mappings by Volchan et al. 1978 and Sousa et al. 1978 . Retrograde labeling in PS was observed in deep cortical horizontal sections that most likely correspond to the fifth layer Fig. 3 . Labeling was not found in ST in all the cases, being restricted or absent in the two animals that received injections of WGA-HRP cases SC1 and SC2 . Along with the possibility that some labeling was located in the unprocessed ventral portion of ST, which represents the more peripheral visual hemifield, we also attribute this failure to some problem related to the survival time that rendered the accumulation of WGA-HRP subthreshold in the ST neurons. Nonetheless, Figure the simple topographic relationship that is known to exist between ST and SC Linden and Rocha-Miranda, 1978 was confirmed every time that transport to ST was success-ful in the other animals that were injected with fluorescent tracers. Likewise, an identical relation was shown be-tween PSal and SC in every case the medial region of SC, which represents the upper quadrant of the visual field Volchan et al., 1978 , received projections exclusively from the lateral portions of ST and PSal, whereas the lateral region of the SC, which represents the lower quadrant of the visual field, received projections from the medial portions of ST and PSal. In some cases more clearly in cases SC1 and SC2 , it was possible to demonstrate a discontinuity in the labeling along the caudorostral axis of PSal. Except for case SC3, retrograde labeling was observed in PSpl in all cases, revealing PSpl projections to the medial portion of SC but not to the lateral portion. Thus, PSpl appeared to be labeled when the single injection of WGA-HRP cases SC1 and SC2 or one of the paired injections of fluorescent tracers DY case SC4 FB case SC5 was injected into medial SC. Conversely, no tracer transport to PSpl was demonstrated when a single injection case SC3 or one of the paired injections FB case SC4 DY case SC5 was applied in the lateral SC. Other cortical domains showed more or less extensive labeling, among them, PA and TM. The orbital cortex OR also appeared to be labeled distinctly in two cases SC3 and SC4 . Conversely, other regions did not seem to project densely to the SC the paramarginal cortex PM appeared to be labeled sparsely only in case SC4, like the frontal lobe and the insular cortex INS in case SC5. The labeling outside the visual regions, when the injection sites were not superficial cases SC1, SC2, SC4, and SC5 , may be correlated with the somatosensory and auditory representations conveyed by cortical projections to the deeper collicular layers Saraiva et al., 1978 . Nevertheless, the labeling in PA and OR in case SC3, in which FB did not penetrate to the deep layers, suggests that corticotectal projections emerging from these regions may be related to visual function.Although, in that case, the halo of the tracer may have reached part of the tract of the inferior colliculus IC , the labeling does not appear to be explained by the transport through an IC-petal pathway, because labeling in the auditory cortex would have been expected i.e. in TM Martin, 1968 . The two cases in which dense labeling was found in OR cases SC3 and SC4 were those in which FB was applied to the lateral portion of SC and not when FB or another tracer was injected into the medial SC, indicating that OR efferents to SC projected mainly to the collicular region where the lower visual quadrant is mapped. The sparse labeling obtainedafterinjectingthelateralSCwithDY caseSC5 may be explained by the small size of the injection. In case PS1, the WGA-HRP injection was centered in the dorsomedial portion of PSal, approximately 1.5 mm from the ST-PS border Fig. 4 . The target tectal region of the PSal projections appeared to be restricted to the lateral portion of SC that represents the lower visual field quad-rant Volchan et al., 1978 . In addition, the anterograde and retrograde labeling in ST encompassed its medial portion down to its posterior limit without invading the posterolateral sector. The labeling in ST was mostly homo-geneous with a single, denser focus approximately 3 mm from the ST-border. This finding may be interpreted as reflecting reciprocal connections between symmetrical ST and PS regions, the more densely labeled ST spot possibly representing the topographic correspondence of the center of the injection. The intrinsic labeling in PS showed two foci of both anterograde and retrograde transport, one immediately rostral and one lateral to the injection site. One anterograde focus appeared nearest to PA. An addi-tional focus of anterograde and retrograde transport was 0 4Interhemispheric connections The tangential and laminar distributions of commis-sural connections were examined in two animals that received multiple injections of HRP into the parietooccipi-tal region. The tangential pattern is portrayed in Figure 5, which shows a horizontal section of the flat-mounted cortex contralateral to the injected hemisphere in case IH1.Aheterogeneous distribution of HRP-filled bodies and terminals was revealed on most of the cortical surface, a pattern similar to that reported by other authors in D. virginiana Benevento and Ebner, 1971 Cusick and Kaas, 1986 and in the mouse opossum, M. elegans Bravo et al., 1990b . A dense interhemispheric band wider than 2 mm was visible in ST running the extent of the PS-ST border. This band appears equivalent to the commissural ââband 1ââ described by Benevento and Ebner 1971 in D. virginiana. The commissural pattern in PSal formed a regular arrange-ment of ring-like domains containing anterograde and retrograde transport surrounding oval gaps or lacunas of poor labeling. At least five rings could be identified adja-cent to ST, and four others were identified more rostrally. The mean diameter of the rings proximal to ST was 2 mm. It is important to stress that, as observed even more clearly in parasagittal sections in another animal case IH2 data not shown , the lacunas actually contained a significant density of commissural cells in layers IIâIII and V. The heterogeneous aspect of the interhemispheric pat-tern largely reflected the fact that the labeling of layers I and IV, which consisted exclusively of terminals, was PSpl practically restricted to the ring-like domains and, on the other hand, that these compartments also accumulated a higher concentration of both terminals and bodies in layers IIâIII and VâVI. This periodic distribution re-sembles the commissural arrangement present in the peristriate cortex of other mammals, in which regularly spaced callosal bands coincide with bands of dense myelina-tion gray squirrels Gould, 1984 Kaas et al., 1989 tree shrews Cusick et al., 1985 primates Cusick et al., 1984 . The coalescence of the rostral portion of PSal commis-sural rings adjacent to ST delineated a continuous strip-like domain approximately parallel to the ST-PS border. This labeled region, which runs through the entire medio-lateral PSal extension, seems to be equivalent to the second commissural band, or ââband 2,ââ of D. virginiana Benevento and Ebner, 1971 . Another domain outlined by the coalescence of segments of the PSal commissural rings was found running along the more anterior and lateral portions of PSal and seemed to contain laterally part of the commissural ââband 3ââ defined by Benevento and Ebner 1971 in the Virginia opossum, a short strip which, according to those authors, extended over the temporal-peristriate transition cortex and the temporal sulcus. In the current study, we applied the terms ââband 3ââ or ââthird bandââ to the entire D. aurita commissural band that conceivably lies along the PSal-PA and PSpl-TM borders. Interestingly, the inspection of parasagittal sections ob-tained in case IH2 not shown revealed that this band is coincident with the anterior peristriate sulcus, reinforcing the notion that it matches the PSal-PAlimit. Furthermore, a lateral commissural strip appeared at the PSal-PSpl limit, coinciding with a commissural segment also de- scribed in the Virginia opossum Benevento and Ebner, 1971 . It is interesting to note that ring-like commissural domains were not found only in PS. TM and PA also showed this distribution in addition to some commissural distinct foci, whereas one commissural lacuna at the INS-TM edge also was observed. Moreover, other territo-ries that showed dense, heterotopic, interhemispheric linkage included OR, which was labeled in its preorbital and postorbital portions, and the frontal lobe, which exhibited a restricted focus in a region adjacent to the rhinal sulcus, a field termed F4 by Ebner 1978 . This latter region is noteworthy because of its connections with several contralateral fields, which include V1 see below and other sensory areas Martinich and Rocha-Miranda, 1993 Martinich et al., 1996 . Connections revealed after a WGA-HRP injection into V1 Corticocortical connections were studied in case ST1, in which a large injection of WGA-HRP was made into a single ST site. Several circumscribed foci of labeled termi-nals were observed in PSal in all of the tangential sections, presumably corresponding to layers IIâIII and IV Fig. 6 . Two strings of multiple foci with labeled terminals succes-sively anterior and parallel to the ST-PS border appeared to be distributed regularly along a large portion of its mediolateral extent. The foci within a same belt were about 1 mm apart. Close to PA, a third, more rostral PSal domain showed a single site labeled by anterograde trans-port. The distribution of all of these PSal foci was symmetri-cal to the injection site in ST. In addition, a dense focus with labeled cells and terminals was visible in PSpl see Fig. 6, inset . These results are similar to those reported for D. virginiana Benevento and Ebner, 1971 on the basis of postlesion axonal degeneration studies and for the mouse opossum Bravo et al., 1990b with the use of WGA-HRP tracing. Low-density retrograde labeling also was observed in a region encompassing the transition of PSal, PSpl, and TM in the central portion of TM in the transition of TM with INS in rostral INS and in the lateral portion of the frontal lobe see Fig. 6, inset . Anterograde and retrograde intrinsic labeling also was evident after the WGA-HRP injections within V1. Antero-grade labeling was visible in the more superficial horizon-tal sections as axonal branches emerging from the injec-tion site and forming periodic and regular puffs up to 7 mm from the center of the injection site Fig. 7A,B . A tendency was observed for these clusters to be distributed into two groups concentric with the injection site. The results resemble those portrayed in studies of V1 in cats Gilbert and Wiesel, 1983 and macaque Amir et al., 1993 in which a role for these connections was proposed, namely, to link neurons of a common family of modules. Figure 7C shows V1 intrinsic retrograde labeling mostly localized in two cellular domains adjacent to the posterior ST dorsal limit, probably corresponding to the infragranular and supragranular layers. The labeling can be observed in the same horizontal section because of the folding of V1 at the posterior margin. The animal in case PS2 received injections of FB and DY into the lateral and medial PSal, respectively, close to the ST-PS border. Supragranular and infragranular cells dis-tributed in a widespread region of the dorsal ST surface that seemed to correspond to the representation of more than 60Â° across the upper and lower visual fields Sousa et al., 1978 were shown to project to each of these PSal sites Fig. 8A , evincing a high degree of convergence in the ST-PSal projections. Conversely, because there is a large ST region in which the labeling of FB and DY overlap, the conclusion emerges that a single site contained in this region projects to both injected sites in PSal, i.e., ST-PSal projections also are highly divergent. Although FB and DY labeling spread broadly, a clear tendency could be observed in the populations labeled with each single tracer to concentrate more densely in ST regions mirror-symmetri-cal to the injection sites in PSal. The diameters of the ST regions containing the densest accumulation of labeling were 3 mm. In this way, despite the characterization of ST-PS projections by high degrees of convergence and divergence, there were plain indications of a topographic arrangement in this distribution. The labeling in PSal appeared irregularly distributed, showing clusters of cells labeled with one tracer or both of the tracers and regions without labeling. These cell aggregates were observed throughout PSal, with both lateral and medial sectors containing DY and FB labeling. FB-and DY-filled cells also were observed in PSpl, in TM, in the caudal portion of PM, and in the transitional region of PA with TM and PSal, with cells labeled by both tracers intermingled. The DY and FB labeling in the contralateral cortex was virtually homotopic. PSal appeared labeled along most of its extent. The tracer-filled cells were distributed in separate assem-blies characteristic of the interhemispheric pattern de-scribed in case IH1. Nevertheless, because this experiment did not reveal anterograde transport, the absence of labeled terminals defined a coarser pattern than that obtained in case IH1. Five aggregates of DY-labeled cells and or FB-labeled cells could be delineated along the mediolateral axis. The three more central domains were labeled with both tracers the more medial contained almost exclusively DY-labeled cells, whereas the most lateral domain contained only FB-labeled cells. This distri-bution is consistent with a rough topographic arrangement of the PS commissural connections. In case ST2, the tracers FB, DY, and RITC were injected into anteromedial, central, and posterolateral portions of the ST, respectively. The results Fig. 8B confirmed and expanded those from previous experiments.Alarge disper-sion of labeled bodies was observed in superficial and deep layers in ipsilateral ST, PSal, PSpl, TM, PM, and INS and in the frontal field F4. Intrinsic labeling in ST consisted of dense halos around the three injection sites and rather uniform aggregates of FB-and DY-filled cells that were progressively less dense in farther regions and sparse beyond 3 mm from the injection sites. The less widespread RITC labeling may have been a consequence of the small size of the injection. In ipsilateral PSal, cells labeled with FB and DY were found in clusters distributed over most of its extent. Although FB and DY labeling of PSal was diffuse, assemblies with the highest density of FB cells tended to be localized in the PSal medial zone, i.e., symmetrical to the injection site with respect to the ST-PSal border. Moreover, the foci more compactly labeled with DY cells were placed laterally with respect to the FB clusters. Cells labeled with RITC also formed clusters in general at the lateralmost portion of PSal, rostral to the corresponding injection site. The clusters seemed to segre-gate in three domains at successively more rostral sites from the ST-PS border. In many zones, the labeling of the three tracers appeared superimposed, and some cases of double labeling with FB and DY were identified not represented . Thus, descending projections from PSal to ST have a tendency to map to equivalent levels of their mediolateral axes. However, the degree of convergence and divergence observed in these projections was high, particu-larly in those labeled with FB and DY, revealing that a single site in ST received afferents from neurons widely placed on the PSal surface. PSpl also appeared labeled, with groups of cells filled with the three tracers with no apparent topographic order. Sparse and relatively homoge-neous FB and DY labeling was observed in other ipsilat-eral regions, including PM, the posterolateral portion of PA, and TM. Dense labeling of FB and DY was concen-</ArticleText></Document></Article>

Bipolar cells convey signals from photoreceptors in the outer retina to amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner retina. In mammals, there are rod bipolar cells, which receive input exclusively from rods, and cone bipolar cells, which receive input from cones reviewed by Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 . Although there is only one type of rod bipolar cell for review, see Chun et al., 1993 , there are several distinct types of cone bipolar cells Kolb et al., 1981 Cohen and Sterling, 1990 Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Mills and Massey, 1992 . In primates, cone bipolar cells are divided into midget bipolar cells, which contact a single cone in the central retina, and diffuse bipolar cells, which contact several cones there Polyak, 1941 Boycott and Dowling, 1969 Kolb et al., 1992 . There are two types of midget bipolar cells Kolb et al., 1969 and at least seven types of diffuse bipolar cells Mariani, 1981 Mariani, 1984 Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Kolb et al., 1992 . One of these, the blue cone bipolar cell, contacts blue cones selectively Mariani, 1984 Kouyama and Marshak, 1992 . The other six types of diffuse bipolar cells DB1-DB6 contact all the cones within their dendritic fields Mariani, 1984 Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Kolb et al., 1992 . Axons of types DB1, DB2, and DB3 ramify in the outer half of the inner plexiform layer IPL sublamina a along with the den-drites of OFF ganglion cells. Because bipolar cells use glutamate as their neurotransmitter and all glutamate effects on primate ganglion cells are excitatory Zhou et al., 1994 , they are presumed to have OFF responses, them-selves. Their dendrites contact cones mainly by basal synapses Hopkins and Boycott, 1995 Hopkins and Boy-cott, 1997 Calkins et al., 1998 . Types DB4, DB5, and DB6 have axons in the inner half of the IPL sublamina b where dendrites of ON ganglion cells are located and, presumably, have ON responses Dacey and Lee, 1994 . Their dendrites contact cones mainly by invaginating synapses Hopkins and Boycott, 1995 Hopkins and Boy-cott, 1997 Calkins et al., 1998 . In addition to the differ-ence in their response polarity, all of the primate diffuse bipolar cells are thought to carry similar, achromatic visual information. The subtypes are distinguished by differences in the morphology and level of stratification of their axon terminals in the IPL. Each type could make a unique contribution to vision if it interacted with different sets of local circuit neurons and different sets of ganglion cells. To begin studying these local circuits, we analyzed the synaptic connections of the DB3 diffuse bipolar cells in the IPL. We selected DB3 bipolar cells for this electron micro-scopic study because they could be labeled with antibodies to the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28K CaBP Martin and Gru Â¨nert, 1992 Gru Â¨nert et al., 1994 . From analysis of Golgi-stained retinas, DB3 and DB2 bipolar cells are known to be similar in many respects Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 , and it was important to determine how they might differ in their synaptic connections. DB3 cells contact 6â11 cones, and about 75% of these basal synapses are triad-associated Hopkins and Boycott, 1995 . On the other hand, approximately half of the DB2 bipolar cell cone synapses are triad-associated Boycott and Hopkins, 1993 reviewed by Hopkins and Boycott, 1997 . The axon termi-nals of DB3 cells are narrowly stratified in stratum 2 of the IPL, and the axons of DB2 cells ramify more broadly throughout sublamina a of the IPL Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 . The boundaries between neighboring DB3 axon terminals are difficult to distinguish because they make extensive appositions Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Jacoby et al., 1999 . Studying serial electron micrographs of labeled DB3 axons, we found that these appositions represent sites of gap junctions between DB3 bipolar cell axons. Gap junctions between bipolar cells of the same type might increase the ratio of signal to noise in their light responses and, possibly, minimize differences between responses of neighboring bipolar cells that contact different numbers of cones Umino et al., 1994 . DB3 bipolar cells are known to provide input to OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells from electron microscopic studies Calkins et al., 1995 Jacoby et al., 2000 . We found that there were 1.5 postsynaptic ganglion cell dendrites per DB3 axonal varicosity, enough for each varicosity to make at least one synapse onto a parasol cell dendrite. The synapses of amacrine cells with diffuse bipolar cells had not been described previously, however. We found that most of the postsynaptic elements at the ribbon synapses of DB3 bipolar cells were amacrine cells. Of the postsynap-tic amacrine cells, 47% made feedback synapses. Some of the amacrine cells that were both presynaptic and postsyn-aptic to DB3 cells were AII amacrine cells, which also receive inputs from rod bipolar cells Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1995 . MATERIALS AND METHODS A light-adapted macaque Macaca mulatta eye was enucleated within 10 minutes after the animal had been overdosed with sodium pentobarbital 50â100 mg kg, IV by other investigators at the conclusion of experiments that did not involve the eyes. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee. The globe was hemi-sected and fixed by immersion for 60 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer PB , pH 7.4 at 37Â°C. The eyecup was then postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB, pH 10, at 4Â°C. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4, the retina was isolated and treated with 1% sodium borohydride PBS for 1 hour followed by an ascend-ing and descending series of graded ethanol solutions in PBS 10 minutes each in 10, 25, and 40% 30 minutes in 50% 10 minutes each in 40, 25, and 10% . The retina was incubated for 7â10 days in 1 1,000 monoclonal mouse anti-calbindin D-28K Sigma, St. Louis, MO in PBS with 0.3% sodium azide, rinsed in PBS, and then incubated for 2 days in 1 100 biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA in PBS. The biotin was visualized by using Vector standard avidin-biotin-peroxi-dase 1 100, overnight at 4Â°C and diaminobenzidine DAB, 0.5 mg ml with hydrogen peroxide 0.005%, 60 minutes . The retina was then treated with osmium tetroxide 1% in PB, 60 minutes and embedded in Epon. Approximately 100-nm serial, vertical sections and random vertical sec-tions from 4 mm eccentricity were collected on Formvar-coated, single-hole grids and stained with uranyl acetate 2% in 50% methanol, 60 minutes and lead citrate 0.2% aqueous, 1â2 minutes . Labeled processes in each section were photographed at 10,0003 by using a rotating, goniom-eter stage to orient the sections and align the synaptic membranes. Of the 100 serial sections analyzed in this study, 70 were used for three-dimensional, graphical reconstruction. The negatives were digitized at a resolution of 600 dpi with a UMAX scanner with a transparency adapter. Individual digitized images were converted into positives, and the contrast was adjusted by using Photoshop 3.0 Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA . The calbindin-immunoreac-tive CaBP-IR processes, the surrounding processes that made synapses with them, and 3â6 fiducial marks were outlined in each image and labeled. With use of estab-lished, ultrastructural criteria Dowling and Boycott, 1966 Koontz and Hendrickson, 1987 , the unlabeled profiles were identified as amacrine cell processes or ganglion cell dendrites, and the synapses were classified as conven-tional or ribbon synapses. Consecutive traced images were aligned by using the fiducial marks and reconstructed by using Neurolucida Microbrightfield, Colchester, VT . DISCUSSION Ribbon synapses from DB3 diffuse bipolar cells provide a substantial proportion of the input to parasol ganglion cells in the macaque retina. Another diffuse bipolar cell type, the more broadly stratified DB2 type, also provides input to parasol ganglion cells Calkins, 1999 . Because both types of bipolar cells are also presynaptic to the small-field bistratified ganglion cells, it is important to determine how the two bipolar cells differ from one an-other and how each contributes to the light responses of the postsynaptic ganglion cells. Previous reports have indicated some differences be-tween DB2 and DB3 bipolar cells Calkins et al., 1995 Hopkins and Boycott, 1995 Hopkins and Boycott, 1997 Calkins et al., 1998 Calkins, 1999 . In the parafovea, Calkins et al. 1995 found that DB2-like bipolar cells formed 43â51 ribbon synapses and that DB3-like cells formed 65â72 ribbons. By calculating the average number of synapses made by reconstructed DB3 axonal varicosi-ties in this study, we could estimate the total number of synapses made by DB3 bipolar cells. Our estimate of 71 ribbons per peripheral DB3 cell is similar to the number from the abstract of Calkins et al. 1995 for a foveal DB3. This finding suggests that the number of output synapses per DB3 cell stays roughly constant with increasing eccen-tricity. Because bipolar cell axon terminal size increases with eccentricity Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1994 Mills and Massey, 1992 Massey and Mills, 1996 and the larger axon terminals in the periphery have the same number of output synapses as smaller ones in central retina, the density of DB3 bipolar cell ribbons in the IPL should decrease with eccentricity. It appears that DB3 bipolars contain a larger number of ribbons than DB2 cells. It is possible, therefore, that the number of ribbons can be used to distinguish diffuse bipolar cells in primates, as is the case for midget bipolar cells in the macaque fovea. In foveal retina midget bipolar cells can be subdivided into a group containing 30 ribbons and another with 50 rib-bons, irrespective of the level of their terminations in the IPL Calkins et al., 1994 . In addition, blue cone-selective bipolar cells in the parafovea make an average of 42 ribbon synapses in the IPL Calkins et al., 1998 , and rod bipolar cells at 1â2 mm eccentricity make roughly 20 ribbon synapses Gru Â¨nert and Martin, 1991 . Thus, each type of primate bipolar cell analyzed to date appears to make a characteristic number of ribbon synapses. In order of increasing number of ribbons, there are rod bipolar cells 20 ribbons , one midget bipolar cell type 30 ribbons , blue cone bipolar cells 42 ribbons , DB2 bipolar cells 43â51 ribbons , the other midget bipolar cell type 50 ribbons , and DB3 bipolar cells 65â72 ribbons . Our results predict that bipolar cell ribbon density in the IPL decreases with eccentricity. This decrease has been demonstrated directly in the cat retina. Kier et al. 1995 found that the density of bipolar cell inputs to ganglion cells per unit area of dendritic field, or retinal density, decreased with increasing eccentricity, although the den-sity of bipolar cell inputs remained constant as a function of dendritic membrane area of the ganglion cells. As with cat ganglion cell dendrites, DB3 axons branch more sparsely as they increase in size. Therefore, the number of ribbons per axonal membrane area could remain constant with eccentricity and still allow the retinal density of bipolar cell ribbons to decrease. If so, this result might explain the inverse relationship between the peak sensitiv-ity of macaque ganglion cells and their dendritic field size. Croner and Kaplan 1994 found that although the peak sensitivity of both P midget and M parasol ganglion cells decreases as dendritic field size increases, the inte- grated sensitivity remains constant. The investigators suggested that larger ganglion cells may have a lower retinal density of synaptic inputs, due to their more sparsely branching dendrites, and, therefore, they would be less sensitive than smaller cells to small spots of light falling on their receptive fields. Our results support this hypothesis. DB3 cells made fewer synapses onto ganglion cells 37% of total output than other known types of cone bipolar cells in primates. At 27% of the dyad synapses, there were two amacrine cells postsynaptic. Midget bipolar cells pro-vide 54% of their output to amacrine cells, and only 9% of their dyads have two amacrine cells Kolb and Dekorver, 1991 Calkins et al., 1994 . The remaining midget bipolar cell dyads have one amacrine cell and one ganglion cell. For blue cone bipolar cells, 48% of the postsynaptic pro-cesses were amacrine cells, and 11% of the dyads had two amacrine cells postsynaptic Marshak et al., 1990 . Rod bipolar cells, however, do not make any synapses onto ganglion cells Gru Â¨nert and Martin, 1991 . Synapses with amacrine cells The majority of both input and output synapses of DB3 axons were with amacrine cells. Some of these had rela-tively electron-lucent cytoplasm and contained only a small number of synaptic vesicles. Two kinds of wide-field amacrine cells that costratify with DB3 axons are those containing immunoreactive choline acetyltransferase ChAT and those containing immunoreactive cholecystoki-nin precursor G6-gly Jacoby et al., 1996 . Cholinergic amacrine cells receive most of their input from bipolar cells Mariani and Hersh, 1988 . Recently, synapses have been found from cholinergic amacrine cells onto bipolar cells, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor immunoreactiv-ity has been localized to a subpopulation of bipolar cells in macaque retina Yamada et al., 1998 . G6-gly-IR amacrine cells also receive synapses from bipolar cells, although fewer than the cholinergic cells receive, and they make synapses onto bipolar cells Marshak et al., 1990 . It is likely that the remainder of the electron-lucent amacrine cells we observed in this study is either GABAer-gic or glycinergic. Most of the synapses between amacrine cells and bipolar cells in macaque IPL involve GABA-IR amacrine cells Koontz and Hendrickson, 1990 . In fact, Enz et al. 1996 showed that the r subunit of the GABAC receptor was localized to 38% of DB3 axonal varicosities. CaBP-IR DB3 varicosities had from 0 to 3 r-immunoreac-tive puncta 0.5 per varicosity, on average . Assuming that each punctum represents a single GABAergic input syn-apse, there would be space for about three additional input synapses per varicosity, because we found 3.36 input synapses per varicosity, overall. This is consistent with results from rat retina, where the putative DB3 homolog, the type 5 cone bipolar cell Euler and Wa Â¨ssle 1995 Jacoby et al., 2000 , was shown to have a much smaller contribu-tion from GABAC receptors than from GABAA receptors relative to other bipolar cells Euler and Wa Â¨ssle, 1998 . Because large amacrine cells in macaque retina typically contain GABA Kalloniatis et al., 1996 , G6-gly-IR ama-crine cells are likely to release GABA, in addition to cholecystokinin, which also has inhibitory actions on briskly responding ganglion cells such as parasol cells Thier and Bolz, 1985 . Other amacrine cell processes that made synapses with DB3 axons in this study resembled the glycinergic AII amacrine cells in macaques Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1995 . Their ultrastructure generally matched the original descriptions of AII amacrine cells from cat Famiglietti and Kolb, 1975 Kolb, 1979 , and those from rabbit Strettoi et al., 1992 and rat Chun et al., 1993 . One difference between AII amacrine cells in macaques and those in cat retina is the size of their output synapses. AII amacrine cells make small, punctate synapses in the cat Famiglietti and Kolb, 1975 . The synapses from AII cells onto DB3 axons, however, were not noticeably smaller than synapses from other amacrine cells. Wa Â¨ssle et al. 1995 also reported that some synapses between calretinin-IR AII amacrine cells and cone bipolar cell axons in the outer half of the macaque IPL were ââquite large.ââ Putative AII amacrine cells were also postsynaptic at DB3 ribbon synapses. AII amacrine cells receive a signifi-cant amount of input from cone bipolar cells in the distal half of the IPL of cat McGuire et al., 1984 , rabbit Strettoi et al., 1992 Merighi et al., 1996 , rat Chun et al., 1993 , human Marc and Liu, 1985 , and macaque Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1995 Gru Â¨nert, 1997 retinas. There is also electrophysi-ological evidence for OFF cone bipolar cell input to AII amacrine cells. In macaque retina, blockade of ON re-sponses with 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrie acid APB un-masks a cone-driven OFF response in AII amacrine cells Stone et al., 1997 . OFF cone bipolar input to an AII cell would create an inhibitory feedback circuit, which could make the bipolar cellâs response after light decrements more transient Strettoi et al., 1992 . This feedback could also sensitize the AII cell by keeping it closer to its threshold for firing action potentials, which may be impor-tant for sensing small rod bipolar cell signals under dark-adapted conditions Chun et al. 1993 . Our finding of synapses between AII amacrine cells and DB3 bipolar cells is consistent with previous studies of AII circuitry and glycine receptor localization in macaque retinas. Roughly 60% of the cone bipolar cell inputs to AII cells and 68% of the outputs from AII cells to cone bipolar cells were found in stratum 2 20â40% depth of the IPL Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1995 , where DB3 cells ramify mean 5 32% depth . Punctate immunoreactivity for the alpha-1 sub-unit of the glycine receptor was also found at the same level of the IPL, and furthermore, some of the puncta were localized to calbindin immunoreactive DB3 axons in stra-tum 2 of the IPL Gru Â¨nert and Wa Â¨ssle, 1996 . The amount of feedback from amacrine cells to bipolar cells may help distinguish bipolar cell types in macaques, as it does in the cat retina Cohen and Sterling, 1990 . We found that 47% of the amacrine cells postsynaptic to DB3 axons made feedback synapses to the same DB3 axon, and, overall, 25% of the amacrine cell inputs were via feedback synapses. On the other hand, a much higher percentage 77% of the amacrine cells postsynaptic to midget bipolar cells make feedback synapses, and 73% of the amacrine cell inputs to midget bipolar cells are via feedback syn-apses Calkins and Sterling, 1996 . Early studies of the macaque IPL suggested that all of the amacrine cell to bipolar cell synapses may be feedback synapses Dowling and Boycott, 1966 , but more recent evidence from specific bipolar cell types analyzed using serial sections indicate that this is not the case. Rod bipolar cells in primates have a smaller proportion of postsynaptic amacrine cells that give feedback, 25% Marc and Liu, 1985 Gru Â¨nert and Martin, 1991 . However, these feedback synapses on rod bipolars account for about the same percentage of the amacrine cell input as for DB3 cells. Overall, 23% of the amacrine cell inputs to rod bipolar cells are feedback synapses. For blue cone bipolar cells, 60% of the postsynaptic amacrine cell processes make feedback synapses Calkins et al., 1998 . Thus, all primate bipolar cells studied so far appear to use feedback circuits, but each type uses them to a different extent. In order of increasing percentages of postsynaptic amacrine cells that give feedback, they are rod bipolar cells, DB3 bipolar cells, blue cone bipolar cells, and midget bipolar cells. Homologs of OFF diffuse cone bipolar cells from the cat have been studied extensively Kolb et al., 1981 McGuire et al., 1984 . Table 3 summarizes the similarities between macaque DB3 bipolar cells and three types of cat bipolar cells that ramify narrowly in sublamina a of the IPL. Each cat bipolar cell has some features in common with DB3 cells, but no single type obviously corresponds to primate DB3 cells based on its ultrastructure, alone. Gap junctions Gap junctions were found wherever two neighboring DB3 axons came into contact. This is the first report of homologous gap junctions between primate bipolar cell axons, but our results are consistent with earlier freeze fracture studies of macaque retina. With use of this technique, gap junctions have been found on the axons Raviola and Raviola, 1982 and dendrites Raviola and Gilula, 1975 of bipolar cells, but at that time, it was not clear what other types of cells were contacted. In whole-mount preparations, the boundaries of individual DB3 axon terminals are difficult to discern because of the frequent appositions between neighboring axons Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Gru Â¨nert et al., 1994 Jacoby et al., 2000 . Because these contacts are the sites of gap junctions, other bipolar cell types that make contacts with bipolar cells of the same type may also form gap junctions. By using this criterion, flat midget bipolar cells are not likely to make junctions with other midget bipolar cells, because neighbor-ing terminals do not contact each other at any eccentricity Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1994 . Fewer data are available for the other bipolar cell types. Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle 1991 presented drawings from Golgi-stained whole-mounts showing groups of neighboring DB1, DB2, and DB5 bipolar cells, but they are not adequate to come to a conclusion as to whether they might make homologous gap junctions. Jeon and Masland 1995 found appositions between wide-field bipo-lar cell axons in the rabbit retina. Gap junctions have been reported between bipolar cells in other species. In cat retina, type CBb4 cone bipolar cells of Cohen and Sterling 1990 make homologous gap junc-tions and gap junctions with CBb3 bipolar cells in the inner sublamina of the IPL. Two types of cat bipolar cells with axons ramifying in the outer sublamina, cb1 and cb2, also make gap junctions with other bipolar cells Kolb, 1979 , a finding that supports the hypothesis that primate DB3 cells and cat cb2 cells are homologous. Mills and Massey 1996 reported that DAPI-Ba3 bipolar cells from rabbit retina were tracer-coupled to other DAPI-Ba3 cells and to DAPI-Ba1 bipolar cells. Bipolar cell axons form homologous gap junctions in salamanders Wong-Riley, 1974 and fish Witkovsky and Stell, 1973 Van Haesen-donck and Misotten, 1983 Kujiraoka and Saito, 1986 Marc et al., 1988 . Umino et al. 1994 also reported gap junctions between the dendrites of neighboring bipolar cells in fish retinas. The function of these gap junctions between bipolar cells has been investigated in fish. Simultaneous intracellular recordings from neighboring bipolar cells showed that current injected into one cell elicited a sign-conserving, sustained potential change in the other cell. The coupling was thought to account for the finding that receptive field centers of bipolar cells are larger than their dendritic fields Kujiraoka and Saito, 1986 . By modeling a coupled net-work of bipolar cells, Umino et al. 1994 found that electrical coupling of bipolar cells could minimize the effects of differences between the numbers of cones presyn-aptic to neighboring bipolar cells. Thus, bipolars of the same type that get input from different numbers of cones would, nevertheless, have similar sensitivity to light. Because macaque DB3 bipolar cells receive input from as few as 6 or as many as 11 cones Boycott and Wa Â¨ssle, 1991 Calkins et al., 1998 , this could be an important function of the homologous gap junctions. Electrical coupling may also improve signal-to-noise ratios by averaging weak cone signals and reducing photoreceptor noise Yamada and Saito, 1997 . Thus, electrical coupling between the presyn-aptic DB3 bipolar cells may account, at least in part, for the high luminance contrast sensitivity of parasol ganglion cells. RESULTS Axon terminals of DB3 diffuse bipolar cells have swell-ings, or varicosities, at regular intervals separated by narrow connecting regions. We studied six DB3 axon segments varying in length from 3â7 Î¼m from midperiph-eral retina 4 mm eccentricity . It was uncertain how many bipolar cells contributed to these axons because the cells were not reconstructed in their entirety, but there were probably at least six. One hundred serial, 100-nm sections were analyzed, and therefore the portion of stra-tum 2 we studied was 10 Î¼m deep and 0.5 mm wide. When a rectangle with these dimensions was placed over a CaBP-labeled whole-mount Jacoby et al., 2000 from the same eccentricity in various orientations, portions of six to nine DB3 axon terminals occupied the area. Calbindin-immunoreactive IR DB3 bipolar cell axons could be identified in the electron microscope by the dense peroxidase reaction product they contained Fig. 1 . Synap-tic ribbons and postsynaptic densities were still easily recognized in the labeled profiles, however. The axons were located at 22â48% mean 5 32 6 5% SD of the distance from the inner nuclear layer INL to the ganglion cell layer GCL , and there were no other CaBP-IR processes at this depth in the IPL. Other CaBP-IR bipolar cell axons were occasionally seen in the inner half of the IPL at a depth of 70â85%. These were probably from DB5 bipolar cells Gru Â¨nert et al., 1994 , and they will not be described further here. Synapses occur at varicosities Because large, beadlike varicosities are a distinctive feature of DB3 cell axon terminals, we wanted to measure their size and describe their synaptic connections. The axon terminals in our sample had 14 varicosities, of which 2 were reconstructed graphically Fig. 2 . The other vari-cosities were followed through serial sections but not graphically reconstructed. The varicosities were ovoid in cross section, with the short axis typically oriented verti-cally, that is, from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells. At their widest points, the short axes of the varicosities were 1.68 6 0.3 Î¼m range, 1.2â2.2 Î¼m in diameter, and the long axes were 2.41 6 0.6 Î¼m, on average. The regions of axons between the varicosities ranged in diameter from 0.1 to 0.3 Î¼m at their narrowest points, averaging 0.2 6 0.08 Î¼m. Therefore, DB3 axon profiles were classified as belonging to a varicosity whenever the short axis diameter was .0.4 Î¼m. Figure 2 shows the two consecutive DB3 varicosities reconstructed graphically from 70 of the sections in our sample of 100 serial sections. We counted 47 conventional synapses onto DB3 axons, 44 94% of which were onto varicosities the remaining 3 were onto narrower axon regions between varicosities examples shown in Fig. 2, triangles . All but 1 29 of 30 of the output, or ribbon, synapses were located inside a varicosity examples shown in Fig. 2, circles . This appears to be a common feature of bipolar cells, because synapses also are concentrated at terminal swellings of rod bipolar cells Gru Â¨nert and Mar-tin, 1991 . There were, on average, 3.36 6 1.78 conven-tional input synapses and 2.14 6 1.25 synaptic ribbons output sites per DB3 varicosity. This resulted in an output synapse to input synapse O I ratio of 0.64. In cat retina, this ratio is generally consistent among bipolar cells of the same type, and it varies between types from 0.9 to 2.6 McGuire et al., 1984 Cohen and Sterling, 1990 . Among primate bipolar cells, rod bipolar cells are the most similar to DB3 cells in this respect, because they have an O I ratio of 0.5 Gru Â¨nert and Martin, 1991 . Midget bipolar cells have roughly the same number of input and output synapses, for an O I ratio of 1 Kolb and Dekorver, 1991 Calkins et al., 1994 , and blue cone bipolar cells have an O I ratio of 2.4 Marshak et al., 1990 . In the following article, we found that there were 33 varicosities per DB3 cell in peripheral retina Jacoby et al., 2000 .Atypical DB3 cell from peripheral retina would, therefore, have 71 synaptic ribbons. We analyzed all the processes that were apposed to five of the DB3 varicosities to determine how many of them actually made synapses. Each varicosity, on average, was contacted by 14 processes range, 9â17 . This is almost certainly a low estimate because some small or obliquely running processes were probably missed. Nevertheless, only 47% range, 33â59% of the apposed processes actu-ally made synapses with the DB3 varicosities. This finding is consistent with results elsewhere in the nervous system, where only half of the contacts between neurons seen with a confocal microscope were found to be synapses using electron microscopy Mann et al., 1997 . Gap junctions We found that the appositions between neighboring DB3 axon terminals observed in the light microscope were sites of gap junctions Fig. 3 . A densitometric scan Fig. 4 of a DB3 gap junction shows that the outer leaflets two central peaks of the membrane were separated by approximately 2 nm, and the inner leaflets larger peaks were approxi-mately 26 nm apart. Two of these homologous gap junc- tions were found in the axon segments in our sample of serial sections. They occurred at the only two sites in our sample where DB3 axons contacted one another. Several more gap junctions were found in random sections, and the junctions were always as large as the area of contact between the two axons Fig. 3 . The gap junctions from the reconstructed series were 0.227 and 0.279 Î¼m2 in area. It is likely, therefore, that gap junctions occur wherever neigh-boring DB3 axons come into contact. Chemical synapses Inputs to DB3 axons came from at least three types of amacrine cells. Some had relatively electron-lucent cyto-plasm and very few synaptic vesicles Fig. 5a, pAs , and others had relatively electron-dense cytoplasm filled with synaptic vesicles Fig. 5b, dAs . Other amacrine cells had large, lobular processes that were electron-dense, filled with synaptic vesicles Fig. 6 and are likely to be from AII amacrine cells, based on descriptions of calretinin-IR AII amacrine cells in macaque retina Wa Â¨ssle et al., 1995 . Like AII cells from other mammals, they had large, rugose profiles that were filled with synaptic vesicles and large mitochondria Famiglietti and Kolb, 1975 Kolb, 1979 Strettoi et al., 1992 Chun et al., 1993 . AII amacrine cells were both presynaptic and postsynap-tic to DB3 bipolar cell axons. The electron-lucent amacrine cells also made feedback synapses Fig. 7a,b . Over half 58% of the feedback synapses were in the same sections as the ribbon input synapses. The average number of sections separating a feedback synapse made by an ama-crine cell and its input from a synaptic ribbon was 2.3 range, 0â8 , which corresponds to a distance of 0.23 Î¼m. However, most of the input to DB3 cells, 75%, was from amacrine cells that did not receive input from DB3 bipolar cells within the area we studied. These were classified as nonreciprocal synapses, although it is possible that some of these amacrine cells got input from DB3 cells outside of the analyzed area. The average maximum diameter of an input synapse was 0.25 6 0.01 Î¼m, both for feedback and nonreciprocal synapses. An average of 3.36 range, 1â7 amacrine cell processes was found presynaptic at each DB3 axonal varicosity, and typically each originated from a different amacrine cell. In only one case did the same amacrine cell process make two synapses onto the same varicosity. Because there were 33 varicosities per DB3 cell, there would be 111 3.36 3 33 chemical synapses onto a peripheral DB3 cell. Two postsynaptic processes were opposed to the DB3 axons at ribbon synapses, forming dyads Dowling and Boycott, 1966 . There was a pair of amacrine cells at 27% of the dyads, and there was one amacrine and one ganglion cell at 53% of the dyads. There were two ganglion cell dendrites at 7% of the dyads and 13% of the dyads contained at least one unidentified process Table 1 . Overall, 57% of the output from DB3 cells was directed to amacrine cells see Table 2 . About half 47% of the postsynaptic amacrine cells made feedback synapses to the DB3 axons Fig. 7a,b . The postsynaptic amacrine cell processes that provided feed-back onto the DB3 axons were significantly larger than those that did not t-test, P 5 0.015 . Processes making feedback synapses averaged 0.91 6 0.43 Î¼m, and those not making feedback synapses averaged 0.61 6 0.34 Î¼m in diameter at the dyads. Five 15% of the postsynaptic amacrine cells made feedforward synapses onto the neigh-boring process at the dyads Fig. 7c,d . Two of these feedforward synapses were onto amacrine cells, and three were onto ganglion cells. Of the postsynaptic processes tentatively identified as ganglion cell dendrites in our material, 47% were classified as dendritic spines because they were less than 0.2 Î¼m in diameter Fig. 1 . The synaptic ribbons of the DB3 bipolar cells were 0.18 6 0.07 Î¼m long, on average. Ganglion cell dendrites made up 37% of the postsynaptic processes Table 2 . At each DB3 axonal varicosity, there were 1.5 range, 0â3 postsynaptic ganglion cell dendrites, on average. In only one instance did the same ganglion cell dendrite receive two synapses from the same varicosity. Therefore, with 33 varicosities, a DB3 cell would be expected to have 50 synapses onto ganglion cells. In the central retina, a reconstructed DB3 bipolar cell provided 9% of its output synapses to a small-field bistratified ganglion cell Calkins et al., 1998 . If peripheral DB3 cells also follow this pattern, then they would make 13 synapses 0.09 3 142 postsynaptic elements onto small-field bistrati-fied ganglion cells, accounting for 26% of the synapses onto ganglion cells. This leaves 37 output synapses per DB3 cell, or slightly more than one synapse per axonal varicos-ity, available for parasol ganglion cells and other ganglion cell types.

The ultrastructural arrangement of the innervation was studied in second-order branches of the rat mesenteric artery using immunohistochemical labelling with antibodies against SP. The structure and distribution of SP-immunoreactive SP1 and SP-negative SP2, i.e., virtually all noradrenergic axons and their terminals within the adventitia of the artery have been determined. Sixteen percent of axons and 22% of varicosities in the perivascular plexus were SP1. Most of the SP1 varicosities lay between 0.4 and 2 Î¼m from the smooth muscle cells, whereas most SP2 varicosities lay much closer to the vessel i.e., ,1 Î¼m . SP1 varicosities typically contained the same number and size of small synaptic vesicles and mitochondria as SP2 varicosities, but there were more large dense-cored vesicles in the SP1 varicosities. Unlike SP2 varicosities, the peptidergic varicosities did not show clustering of synaptic vesicles toward one part of the axon membrane, and none of them formed junctions with the smooth muscle cells. Close relationships between SP1 and SP2 varicosities lacked any detectable structural specialization. The arrangement of SP1 primary afferent termi-nals and their association with vascular smooth muscle cells indicates that peptide released from afferent terminals must diffuse further than noradrenaline from sympathetic terminals to reach the vascular smooth muscle. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 277â290, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The perivascular plexus of nerve terminals around some arterial vessels is known to contain, in addition to norad-renergic sympathetic postganglionic axons, varicose end-ings of primary afferent neurones Edvinsson et al., 1989 . These terminals arise from cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia and contain two co-localised neuropeptides, sub-stance P SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP Holzer, 1992 . One of the densest peptidergic vascular innervations is that around the mesenteric arteries Fur-ness et al., 1982 Barja et al., 1983 . These axons may be the collaterals of primary afferent neurones that also project to the intestinal mucosa. It has been suggested that they play a role in an axon reflex that increases intestinal blood flow when chemoreceptors in the gut segment, to which they are also connected, are activated Ro Â´zsa et al., 1986 . On the other hand, they may act to signal the central nervous system about the state of the arteries perfusing an individual gut segment Holzer, 1992 . The mesenteric artery of the rat has been extensively used for pharmacological studies of the vasculature, includ-ing the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation Mulvany et al., 1977 Angus et al., 1988 Sjo Â¨blom-Widfeldt, 1990 . When the nerves to an isolated mesenteric artery are stimulated electrically, the vessel constricts. However, if the vessel is precontracted with methoxamine, and gua-nethidine is used to block release of catecholamines, transmural stimulation produces relaxation Kawasaki et al., 1988 . In rat vessels, this relaxation is mimicked by exogenous CGRP but not by SP Kawasaki et al., 1990 and is blocked by CGRP Han et al., 1990 . Transmural stimu-lation after pretreatment with capsaicin, which blocks release of the peptides, produces a much larger constric-tion than in normal vessels Kawasaki et al., 1990 Li and Duckles, 1992 . These observations indicate that neurally released peptides can modulate vascular tone in this vessel. We have previously described the presence of high densities of neuromuscular junctions at several levels of the mesenteric arterial tree in the rat Luff and McLach-lan, 1989 . However, in that study, conventional electron microscopy was used, and consequently it was not clear whether these junctions were made by noradrenergic sympathetic or peptidergic afferent axons. Three different types of peptidergic axons containing SP, vasoactive intes-tinal polypeptide [VIP] and neuropeptide Y, respectively as well as sympathetic varicosities containing the nor-adrenaline-synthesising enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, have been reported to form neuromuscular junctions in rat cerebral arteries Matsuyama et al., 1985 . In the present study, we sought to determine the ultrastructure of SP-containing afferent nerves to compare the structure of their varicosities with those of sympathetic varicosities. In addition, we sought to define the relationship between SP-containing axons in the perivascular plexus and the smooth muscle cells of second-order mesenteric arteries of the rat. In particular, we aimed to identify the presence or absence of peptidergic neuromuscular junctions and to determine whether or not there were axo-axonal relation-ships suggestive of a direct prejunctional locus of interac-tion between sensory and sympathetic axons Holzer, 1992 . Intracellular components Vesicles. Both SP1 and SP2 varicosities contained several hundred small clear vesicles with similar mean numbers in each varicosity. The number of small vesicles per varicosity was correlated with varicosity size for both varicosity types Fig. 8A with the density of vesicles in each varicosity being inversely related to varicosity vol-ume. However, the slope of this relationship was steeper for SP1 than for SP2 varicosities Fig. 8C . Mean vesicle density was not significantly different between SP1 and SP2 varicosities 1,110 6 216 Î¼m3 and 720 6 46 Î¼m3, respectively P , 0.08 . However, the vesicle densities were more variable in SP1 than SP2 varicosities with some having high and others low values. The highest vesicle density values were for small varicosities that lacked mitochondria cf. Fig. 8C,D . No clustering of small vesicles was associated with any region of the varicosity membrane in SP1 varicosities Fig. 9 . In contrast, in each of the four reconstructed non-contacting SP2 varicosities lying in a similar location, small synaptic vesicles were clustered toward the region of bare membrane facing the muscle Fig. 10 . Large dense-cored vesicles were scattered throughout both SP1 and SP2 varicosities with no apparent organisation. There were significantly more large dense-cored vesicles in SP1 than in SP2 varicosities Table 2 . The number of large dense-cored vesicles in each varicosity varied greatly but was directly related to varicosity volume Fig. 8B . Most SP1 varicosities 85% had more than four large dense-cored vesicles, and the proportion of large dense-cored vesicles to small vesicles within individual varicosi-ties was greater in SP1 3.5 6 1.7% than in SP2 varicosities 1.8 6 0.7% P , 0.002 . It was not possible to determine whether or not presyn-aptic membrane specialisations PMS were present in SP1 varicosities due to the density of reaction product associated with the vesicle membranes see above . A PMS was, however, detected in one of the 15 reconstructed non-contacting SP2 varicosities. Mitochondria. Most varicosities of both types con-tained a single mitochondrion, whereas one of each type had two mitochondria. The mitochondria were sometimes very small and sometimes elongated, but never branched cf. rat tail artery, Luff et al., 1995 . Two very small SP1 varicosities 0.07 and 0.08 Î¼m3 lacked mitochondria . Mitochondria were of a similar size in both varicosity types Table 2 . The proportion of the varicosity volume occupied by mitochondria was smaller for SP1 than SP2 varicosities 4.4 6 1.0% and 8.4 6 1.1%, respectively, P 5 0.02 , but similar to that in non-contacting varicosities of the rat tail artery 6%, Luff et al., 1995 . Mitochondrial volume was positively correlated with varicosity size for SP1 but not for SP2 varicosities Fig. 8D . MATERIALS AND METHODS Immunofluorescence of sympathetic and primary afferent axons This study was approved by the relevant animal ethics committees of Monash University and The Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute and was conducted in accor-dance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. Wistar Kyoto rats both sexes, 42â53 days of age were killed with an overdose of pentobarbitone 100 mg kg i.p. . Second-order branches of the superior mesenteric arteries were pinned out under physiological saline, which was subsequently replaced by Zamboniâs fixative. After incuba-tion overnight 4Â°C , followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline PBS, pH 7.3 containing 30% sucrose, 10 mm lengths of the arteries were either tied into moulds prior to freezing so that serial longitudinal cryostat sec-tions 14 Î¼m could be cut, or they were washed and stained en bloc. Immunohistochemical processing was performed as de-scribed previously McLachlan et al., 1994 . Briefly, after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO or 50% ethanol, the tissue was incubated in antibody to SP raised in rabbit Incstar, Stillwater, MN 1 2,000, together with either a anti-tyrosine hydroxylase TH raised in mouse Incstar 1 500, or b anti-CGRP raised in goat Arnel, New York, NY 1 500, overnight at room temperature. This was followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC -labelled anti-rabbit IgG Amersham, Little Chal-font, UK 1 50, together with CY3-labelled anti-mouse IgG Jackson, Westgrove, PA 1 200, or b FITC-labelled anti-goat IgG Jackson 1 50, together with CY3-labelled anti-rabbit IgG Jackson , 1 200, for 1â2 hours. Some tissues sections were treated with the same mouse anti-TH antibody together with anti-CGRP raised in rabbit Geno-sys, The Woodlands, UK 1 1,000. In a few cases, tissues were incubated in antibody to TH raised in sheep Pel-Freez, Rogers, AK 1 1,000, together with anti-VIP raised in rabbit 1 2,000, or in anti-synaptophysin raised in mouse Dako, Glostrup, Denmark 1 200 together with either anti-SP or anti-TH as above . Appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies were used in each case. Control preparations processed in an identical way but without incubation in primary antibody lacked staining of the perivascular plexus. Sections were visualised by epifluores-cence using Leitz Ploempak Filters L4 and N2 and photo-graphed on Tmax 400 film, or using an Olympus confocal microscope. Computer images were adjusted only for brightness and contrast using Photoshop 4.0. Tissue preparation for electron microscopy Mesenteric arteries from three male Wistar Kyoto rats aged 50 days were fixed by perfusion under deep anaesthe-sia 70 mg kg pentobarbitone i.p. . The animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaralde-hyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3 via the left ventricle of the heart at a pressure of ,80 mmHg. Second-order branches of the superior mesenteric artery from the ileum region of the small intestine were immediately dissected out under fresh fixative. Some vessels were post-fixed at 4Â°C overnight in the same fixative and processed for pre-embedding immunohistochemical locali-sation of substance P see below . Other equivalent vessels were processed for the demonstration of catecholamines see below . ter permeabilization with 50% ethanol, the vessels ,10 mm long were incubated in 10% horse serum and then in anti-SP antibody raised in rabbit Auspep, Parkville in PBS containing 10% horse serum overnight at 4Â°C. The concentration of primary antibody was varied according to the type of analysis that was to be conducted see below . The vessels were then incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG Sigma, St. Louis, MO 1 200 in PBS with 1% horse serum for 3 hours at room temperature. The subsequent reaction using Vectastain Vector Laborato-ries, Burlingame, CA was monitored under a microscope until no further staining of the perivascular plexus was observed. The vessels were counterstained in 0.5% os-mium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3 for 30 minutes and embedded in Epon. Longitudinal sections 80â100-nm-thick were cut from the mid-region of each vessel and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. hyde-fixed vessels were post-fixed in 4% potassium dichro-mate pH 6 at 4Â°C for 6 hours Ferguson et al., 1986 , washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 , and placed in 2% osmium for 4 hours at room temperature. The tissue was then embedded in Epon, and longitudinal sections ,100-nm-thick were cut from the mid-region of three vessels each from a separate animal . These sections were stained in lead citrate.

The following definitions were used in all the analyses. ââVaricositiesââ were axon profiles . 0.5 Î¼m in diameter that contained accumulations of synaptic vesicles 50 nm in diameter ââintervaricositiesââ were axon profiles ,0.5 Î¼m in diameter, lacking synaptic vesicles but contain-ing microtubules Luff et al., 1987 ââaxonsââ were all axon profiles, i.e., including varicosities and intervaricosities ââsynaptic vesiclesââ were ,50 nm in diameter ââdense-cored vesiclesââ were ,100 nm in diameter with an electron-dense core ââneuromuscular junctionsââ or ââcontacting vari-cositiesââ were varicosities that were in contact with a smooth muscle cell with an intervening gap of ,100 nm containing a single basal lamina Luff et al., 1987 âânon-contacting varicositiesââwere varicosities that, after having been followed in serial sections through their entirety, were found not to form a neuromuscular junction Luff et al., 1995 . Care was taken to prepare all vessels under similar conditions. However, the linear measurements are com-parative rather than representative of in vivo dimensions as no attempt was made to adjust for any shrinkage during processing. Proportion and distribution of SP-immunoreactive axons. Single longitudinal sections 900-Î¼m-long cut from the mid-region of vessels were selected for analysis on the basis of the density of immunoreactivity and the quality of preservation of tissue. The concentrations of SP antibody used were 1 500, 1 1,000, or 1 4,000. Two short ribbons of three to four consecutive sections ,100 nm thick from six vessels two from each animal were mounted on Formvar-coated slot grids one grid was stained with saturated uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate and the other grid was left unstained. A stained section from the middle of the ribbon was selected for analysis. Reference was made to the adjacent ribbon of unstained sections if the presence of immunoreactivity was ambigu-ous Fig. 1 . As the sections contained two sides of each vessel, ,1,800 Î¼m of vessel surface was analysed in each section. One vessel from each animal was analysed directly in the electron microscope. Micrographs were prepared of all axon bundles lying within the adventitia of the other three vessels and enlarged to a magnification of 315,000. The number of axon bundles and the number of SP1 and SP2 axons and varicosities contained in each bundle were determined for all six vessels. The minimum distance of each bundle and axon varicosity from the outer layer of smooth muscle cells was determined using a micrometer graticule in a 310 magnifying lens. Proportion of catecholamine-containing axons. The numbers of chromaffin-positive and -negative varicosities i.e., varicosities with small synaptic vesicles containing electron-dense granules Fig. 2A were determined in each section. Dimensions of SP-immunoreactive varicosities and neuromuscular relationships. Thirty SP1 and 15 SP2 varicosities were analysed in series of longitudinal thin sections of one vessel prepared from each animal. The numbers of sections in each series were 35, 52, and 96, respectively. The analyses were restricted to the region of the adventitia ,1 Î¼m from the medio-adventitial border because previous studies showed that the axons that formed neuromuscular junctions lay within this region Luff et al., 1995 . Eight axon bundles, in which the axon profiles could be clearly identified and that contained SP1 axons, were selected from along the entire length of the middle section from each series. From these bundles, ten SP1 and 5 SP2 varicosities were selected from each vessel and photographed in consecutive sections through the entire varicosity i.e., from one intervaricosity to the next . The micrographs were enlarged to a magnification of 315,000, from which varicosity volumes and surface areas were determined using a graphics tablet and associated custom software Luff et al., 1987 . ties. Analyses were conducted on series of 55, 57, and 59 longitudinal sections from each animal, respectively. These sections were thinner ,80 nm and were cut from vessels immuno-reacted with low concentrations of primary anti-body 1 8,000 and 16,000 so that the vesicles and mitochon-dria within the varicosities were clearly visible. It should be noted that the numbers of small synaptic vesicles could only be determined in 11 of the SP2 varicosities. Clearly defined varicosities were selected for three-dimensional reconstruction from the middle section of each series. Eleven SP1 varicosities three, three, and five from each animal, respectively and four non-contacting SP2 vari-cosities from three animals were reconstructed for com- parison. Ten of the 11 SP1 varicosities were located ,1 Î¼m and one .1 Î¼m from the smooth muscle. All SP2 varicosi-ties lay ,1 Î¼m from the smooth muscle. Serial micro-graphs through entire varicosities 331,000â38,000 were prepared from which three-dimensional reconstructions were made Luff et al., 1987 . The number and distribution of dense-cored and small synaptic vesicles and the size and location of mitochondria within each varicosity were determined, together with the relationships of SP1 vari-cosities to the nearest smooth muscle cell and to SP2 varicosities. Statistics Analysis of co-variance was used to determine whether there was a difference between these relationships for SP1 and SP2 varicosities Systat v. 5.0, Evanston, IL . Regres-sion analysis was performed using Statview SAS Insti-tute, Cary, NC . Data are presented as mean 6 SEM, unless otherwise stated. DISCUSSION In the present study, the SP1 axons in the perivascular plexus of the small distributing arteries of the rat ileum have been characterised and compared with the SP2 axons. These arteries have a relatively dense afferent innervation, with 13% of axon profiles and 21% of varicos-ity profiles containing SP. This is a significantly higher proportion of SP1 axons than is present around rat cerebral arteries where ,5% of axon profiles contain SP Matsuyama et al., 1985 . The similarity between the proportions of SP1 axons and varicosities and of chromaf-fin-negative axons and varicosities, together with the paucity of VIP1 axons Uddman et al., 1981 , confirms that the SP2 component of the innervation is largely sympathetic and they will be referred to as such in this discussion. None of 40 reconstructed SP1 varicosities formed a neuromuscular junction, and no SP1 neuromus-cular junctions were identified in random sections. The dimensions and organelles of SP1 varicosities were largely indistinguishable from those of non-contacting SP2 vari-cosities. The only difference was a greater number of large dense-cored vesicles in the peptidergic varicosities. Arrangement of afferent axons and their relationship to vascular smooth muscle CGRP was co-localized with SP in virtually all perivascu-lar peptidergic axons see also Gibbins et al., 1985 this combination of peptides is present in a subpopulation of fine afferent axons which are thought to be nociceptive in many tissues. The SP1 axons generally travelled in the same bundles as noradrenergic axons, but they terminated before the bundles reached the medio-adventitial border. None of 40 reconstructed SP1 varicosities in the perivas-cular plexus around the mesenteric arteries made direct contact with the basal lamina of the vascular smooth muscle. The shortest distance between an SP1 varicosity and a smooth muscle cell was 270 nm. We previously calculated an innervation density of 47,100 neuromuscu-lar junctions mm2 of vessel surface in this artery Luff and McLachlan, 1989 . The present data imply that these junctions are all SP2 and presumably noradrenergic . This contrasts with the arrangement of SP-containing terminals around rat cerebral arteries, where several types of peptidergic axons including SP1 ones form junctions with an intervening single basal lamina Matsu-yama et al., 1985 similar to those formed by noradrenergic axons in most other vessels Luff, 1996 . In the central nervous system and peripheral ganglia, SP1 terminals form synapses with conventional pre-and post-synaptic specialisations with other nerve processes Kummer, 1992 Chen et al., 1994 . Associations between SP1 and SP2 axons in the perivascular plexus Afferent varicosities were commonly found closely ap-posed to SP2 varicosities with no intervening Schwann cell, suggesting that direct interaction might occur be-tween afferent and efferent nerves in this tissue. Nor-adrenaline at very low concentrations modulates primary afferent vasodilatation mediated by CGRP on precon-stricted blood vessels Kawasaki et al., 1988 by inhibiting peptide release via presynaptic alpha2 receptors Ka-wasaki et al., 1990 . Such modulation would be facilitated if noradrenaline released from one varicosity could act directly on an adjacent peptidergic varicosity. There is also evidence suggesting that noradrenaline release may be modulated by released peptides Holzer, 1992 . Comparison between afferent and sympathetic varicosities The SP1 varicosities were morphologically similar in almost all the parameters measured to the non-contacting SP2 ones and to the non-contacting noradrenergic varicosi-ties around the rat tail artery Luff et al., 1995 . Both types of varicosities had simple fusiform shapes and similar surface area to volume ratios and contained numerous small vesicles, some large dense-cored vesicles and, in most cases, a single mitochondrion Table 2 . However, the varicosities around the mesenteric arteries were signifi-cantly smaller than those around the rat tail artery Table 2 . Although ,30% of the varicosities in the present study were ,1 Î¼m in diameter and would have been excluded from the study of the rat tail artery, the mean volume of those varicosities $ 1 Î¼m in diameter i.e.. 0.65 Î¼m3 was still only 44% of the volume of non-contacting varicosities around the tail artery. It is unlikely that the proportions of SP1 axons and varicosity profiles determined in this study were underes-timated due to a failure to stain them immunohistochemi-cally as the proportion of SP2 and chromaffin-positive varicosity profiles around equivalent vessels, were similar. Indeed, the proportion of SP1 axon profiles encountered in single sections that were classified as varicosities was twice that of SP2 ones. As the volumes of varicosities of each type were similar Table 2 , this suggests that inter-varicosity length is much shorter for SP1 than for SP2 axons. If this is the case, then the proportion of varicosities that are SP1 would be closer to 10% than 21% Table 1 , as the probability of sectioning through an SP1 varicosity would be greater than that for an SP2 varicosity. In non-contacting noradrenergic varicosities, both in the present study and in the rat proximal tail artery Luff et al., 1995 , small synaptic vesicles were found to be aggre-gated within the varicosity toward the membrane closest to the smooth muscle, whereas the mitochondrion lay on the opposite side of the varicosity. Occasional PMSs were encountered at a frequency similar to that in other sympa-thetic varicosities Luff, 1996 . This contrasts with the lack of vesicle aggregation in SP1 varicosities. Furthermore, the SP2 varicosities had twice as much bare membrane facing the artery as the SP1 varicosities. The density of small synaptic vesicles was on average slightly, although not significantly, higher in peptidergic than in noradrener-gic varicosities. The density in noradrenergic ones 720 Î¼m3 was virtually identical to that in the non-contacting varicosities around the rat tail artery 845 Î¼m3 Luff et al., 1995 . The absence of structural organisation of the small synaptic vesicle population within SP1 varicosities pro-vides no clue as to their role or whether they are actively involved in exocytosis. There is evidence that glutamate, which is colocalized with SP at the central endings of primary afferents Battaglia and Rustioni, 1988 , can be released in the skin by activation of the peripheral termi- nals Carlton et al., 1995 Davidson et al., 1997 . It may be relevant that synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle protein important in organising the assembly of vesicles at the presynaptic membrane at synapses, was present in nearly all TH1 varicosities but was not detected in SP1 varicosi-ties. Large dense-cored vesicles were distributed throughout the varicosities, both in those around the mesenteric arteries Figs. 9, 10 and in other tissues Asa Ë et al., 1988 . Although the number of large dense-cored vesicles in the peptidergic varicosities was higher than in noradrenergic varicosities, it was very low relative to the number of small vesicles. The large dense-cored vesicles contain neuropep-tides Klein and Thureson-Klein, 1984 Thureson-Klein, 1984 Asa Ë et al., 1988 , and the amount of stored peptide is generally found to be limited, the main source being that transported from the soma Brimijoin et al., 1980 Keen et al., 1982 . In other tissues, large dense-cored vesicles that appear to be undergoing exocytosis are usually found away from the synaptic active zone Asa Ë et al., 1988 , which is consistent with the lack of organization observed here. However, peptide release can be functionally effective after a single transmural stimulus in this vessel, and responses do not fade during low-frequency repetitive stimuli Ka-wasaki et al., 1988 . The paucity of vesicles is therefore consistent with a very low probability of exocytosis but a high effectiveness of the contents of each vesicle. The modulatory effect on sympathetic vasoconstriction of neuropeptides derived from afferent axons is post-synaptic Han et al., 1990 Kawasaki et al., 1990 . Our data suggest that released peptide must diffuse through the perivascular plexus to have effects on the vascular smooth muscle. In other tissues, SP1 terminals can have potent actions despite lying at even greater distances from their effectors, e.g., in the airway endothelium where the nearest SP1 terminals are 1â2 Î¼m from the mucosa Baluk and Gabella, 1991 . SP released in the upper laminae of the spinal dorsal horn diffuses for several hundreds of micrograms without breakdown by endopepti-dases Hope et al., 1990 . Thus, although the peptide release mechanism and its structural components remain unknown, there seems to be little to prevent neurally derived peptides from accessing their receptors on the vascular muscle membrane. RESULTS Distribution of immunofluorescent perivascular terminals Double-labelling immunofluorescence showed that there were fewer SP-immunoreactive axons than TH-immunore-active TH1 ones in the perivascular plexus around second-order mesenteric arteries and that VIP1 axons were extremely rare. The SP1 axons were usually present in bundles containing several TH1 axons Figs. 2B,C, 3A,B, 4 . Confocal microscopy confirmed that there was no detectable overlap of staining for SP and TH in individual varicosities or for SP and synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle protein which identifies terminal varicosities Fig. 3C,D . There was almost complete overlap between synap-tophysin and TH. Double labelling for TH and CGRP revealed an arrangement identical to that for TH and SP. Double labelling for SP and CGRP confirmed that these two peptides were co-localised in virtually all TH2 axons. Most peptidergic axons appeared to lie in bundles lo-cated superficial to the noradrenergic plexus at the medio-adventitial border, being largely absent from axon bundles in the region immediately adjacent to the media in vessels optically sectioned in the confocal microscope. Ultrastructural features of SP-immunoreactive axons and varicosities The innervation was confined to the adventitia in rat mesenteric vessels, with most axon bundles ,80% lo-cated within 1 Î¼m of the medio-adventitial border of the artery Fig. 5A . In confirmation of the confocal observa-tions Fig. 3A,B , the SP1 axons were almost always present in bundles containing SP2 axons Figs. 2, 4 . SP1 or SP2 axons, including single axons, were always par-tially or completely enveloped in Schwann cell processes which often, but not always, separated axons from each other within bundles Figs. 2, 4 . There was an extensive external elastic lamina Figs. 2, 4 at the medio-adventitial border with occasional fenestra-tions. Most axons lay outside this lamina Figs. 1, 2, 4 , but sometimes axons lay adjacent to the smooth muscle where there were fenestrations Fig. 4 . In the more lightly stained tissues, SP-immuno-reactivity appeared as fine electron-dense granular mate- rial in the cytoplasm that was typically concentrated on the outer surface membrane of small 50 nm agranular vesicles and mitochondria Fig. 4 see also Matsuyama et al., 1985 . Both SP1 and chromaffin-negative varicosities contained numerous small 50 nm clear vesicles and occasional larger ,100 nm dense-cored vesicles and mitochondria Fig. 2B,C . Proportion and distribution of SP1 axons in the adventitia Axon bundles contained between 1 and 27 axons mean 4.3 6 0.3, n 5 191 bundles from three vessels , the distribution being highly skewed with a median of 3 Fig. 5C . Both the number of bundles and the number of axons increased markedly as the distance to the medio-adventi-tial border decreased Fig. 5A . We conclude that both bundles and axons branched extensively within 1 Î¼m of their target. Most axon bundles 73% lay .0.4 Î¼m from the muscle at their closest point Fig. 5A . This reflects the barrier provided by the extensive external elastic lamina. Almost all SP1 axons 2259 of 2273, i.e., 99% were present in bundles together with SP2 axons, but less than half the axon bundles contained SP1 axons. Of the 14 SP1 axons not associated with SP2 axons, one occurred as a single axon and the others were in bundles of 2, 3, and 6 SP1 axons, respectively. The relative proportions of struc-tures immunoreactive for SP are summarised in Table 1. The proportion of axon bundles that contained SP1 axon profiles was similar at all distances from the muscle Fig. 5E . Within the bundles that contained SP1 axons, about a third 35 6 5% of the axons showed immunoreactivity, with 16% of all axons being SP1 Table 1 . The proportion of SP1 axons per bundle was greatest between 1.5 and 2 Î¼m from the medio-adventitial border and decreased as the bundles approached the vessel Fig. 5F where SP2 axons predominated see also Fig. 6 . The bundles that contained SP1 axons were on average larger 6.1 6 0.6 axons, n 5 204 bundles than those that did not 3.2 6 0.4 axons, n 5 261 bundles, P # 0.0001 . This was also true of smaller bundles, i.e., those that contained #6 axons with SP1, 4.0 6 0.2 axons, n 5 125 bundles cf. without SP1 axons, 3.2 6 0.1 axons, n 5 240 bundles, P , 0.0001 . Proportion and distribution of SP1 varicosities in the adventitia Half of the axon profiles were classified as varicosities see Materials and Methods Table 1 . The maximum number of varicosities in a bundle was 20, but most bundles contained 1â3 varicosities Fig. 5D , and 11% of bundles consisted only of intervaricosities. The proportion of axon profiles that were classified as varicosities was highest in bundles ,1Î¼m from the smooth muscle Fig. 6A . Approximately 20% of all axons were SP1 Table 1 . Many more of the SP1 than the SP2 axon profiles were classified as varicosities 77% and 45%, respectively . The SP1 varicosities lay predominantly between 0.6 and 2 Î¼m from the smooth muscle Fig. 6C , with 77.6 6 2.1% being evenly distributed throughout this region. This contrasts markedly with the distribution of SP2 varicosities, 76.8 6 1.7% of which lay ,1 Î¼m from the smooth muscle cells Fig. 6C . In the region ,1Î¼m from the smooth muscle, less than 10% of all the varicosities were SP1, but in the region between 1 and 1.6 Î¼m from the smooth muscle, nearly 40% of all the varicosities were SP1. There was no significant difference P 5 0.21 between the proportion of varicosities that were SP1 15.3 6 3.6% and those that were chromaffin-negative in vessels post fixed in potassium dichromate 10.8 6 0.8% . Relationship between SP1 varicosities and vascular smooth muscle More than half 61.5 6 2.4% of the varicosities lay ,1 Î¼m from the nearest smooth muscle Figs. 6B, 7 . Some SP2 varicosities formed neuromuscular junctions Luff et al., 1989 , but these are not included in the present analysis. None of the SP1 varicosities formed a junction with the vascular smooth muscle. The minimum distance between an SP1 varicosity and the muscle was 270 nm, and all but four i.e., 90% lay .400 nm from the artery at their closest point. The relationship between minimum and maximum distances from the muscle Fig. 7B was similar for both types of non-contacting varicosity, as was the minimum distance that each type of varicosity lay from the nearest smooth muscle cell Fig. 7, Table 2 . Varicosity volume was not related to distance from the artery for either SP1 or SP2 varicosities. Most SP1 varicosities 96% were bare of Schwann cell along some region of their membrane. The area that was bare was 0.51 6 0.7 Î¼m2, or 16.9 6 1.8% of their total surface area, which was less than that for SP2 varicosities 0.82 6 0.11 Î¼m2, or 24.8 6 2.0% of surface area, P , 0.02 . Most SP1 varicosities 88% , had bare membrane facing towards the vessel Figs. 4A,B, 9A,B , 8% had bare mem-brane only along their surface facing away from the smooth muscle cells Fig. 4A,B , and 33% SP1 were bare both toward and away from the artery Figs. 4B, 9A . Only two SP1 varicosities in this sample were totally enclosed in Schwann cell. In contrast, all SP2 varicosities were bare of Schwann cell toward the muscle, and 27% also had bare membrane facing away from it. For SP1 varicosities, the surface area of membrane that was bare of Schwann cell toward the smooth muscle cells was significantly larger 0.35 6 0.06 Î¼m2 than the area of membrane that was bare facing away from the smooth muscle 0.15 6 0.04 Î¼m2, P 5 0.004 . The same was true for the non-contacting SP2 varicosities i.e. 0.72 6 0.07 Î¼m2 bare toward and 0.10 6 0.06 Î¼m2 bare away from the smooth muscle P , 0.0001 . Thus, SP1 varicosities lying ,1 Î¼m from the medio-adventitial border had a smaller area of membrane bare of Schwann cell facing toward the smooth muscle than non-contacting SP2 varicosities in the same region P , 0.001 . However, there was no difference in the areas of membrane that were bare away from the muscle between the two types of varicosity Relationships between SP1 and SP2 varicosities Some SP1 varicosities abutted other SP1 as well as SP2 varicosities without any intervening Schwann cell Figs. 2B,C, 4 . This was true for most 8 11 of the reconstructed SP1 varicosities all of which were in contact with an SP2 varicosity. One SP1 varicosity was sur-rounded by three SP2 varicosities Fig. 4B . At regions of membrane apposition between SP1 and SP2 varicosities without intervening Schwann cell, the axon membranes were often flattened with an intervening space of about 20 nm Fig. 4B . However, no structural specialisations sug-gestive of axo-axonal synapses, such as vesicle aggrega-tions, were associated with the apposing membranes of either varicosity type. Dimensions of SP1 varicosities Varicosity dimensions were obtained from 40 SP1 and 11â15 non-contacting SP2 varicosities Table 2 and de-tails of intracellular organelles from 10 SP1 and 15 SP2 varicosities. All these non-contacting varicosities lay ,1 Î¼m from the smooth muscle. Overall, the dimensions of the two types of varicosity were similar, with mean volumes of ,0.5 Î¼m3 Table 2 ranges, SP1 5 0.07â1.23 Î¼m3 and SP2 5 0.19â0.97 Î¼m3 . Both types of varicosity were slightly elongated Figs. 9, 10 with similar surface area to volume ratios Table 2 . CONCLUSIONS Peptidergic varicosities do not make contact with the mesenteric artery. They often terminate .0.5 Î¼m from the vessel, where they make up about 30% of the axons present. The two types of terminals are morphologically very similar. The most significant structural differences found were that the SP1 varicosities contain more dense-cored vesicles and have no preferred orientation of their vesicles in relation to the plasma membrane. Thus there are no structural specialisations resembling those in norad-renergic varicosities or other synapses. The close relation-ship between some SP1 and SP2 varicosities within the axon bundles is consistent with direct interaction at the prejunctional level.

Cortex rostral and caudal to the primary somatosensory area (SI) contained neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and to muscle and joint manipulation. The region of cortex rostral to SI was termed the rostral field (R) because of possible homologies with a similar field described in other mammals. Cortex caudal to SI had neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and has been termed the parietal medial area (PM), as in previous investigations in squirrels. Like SI, both R and PM contained a complete or almost complete representation of the body surface, although the receptive field size for clusters of neurons in these regions was somewhat larger than those for clusters of neurons in SI. Electrophysiological recording results were correlated with histologically processed tissue that had been sectioned tangentially. Although SI was clearly identified as a myelin-dense region, both R and PM stained much less densely for myelin. Our results indicate that as in a number of other mammals including monotremes, marsupials, carnivores, and primates, the anterior parietal cortex of the California ground squirrel contains multiple representations of the sensory epithelium. This work, as well as a growing body of studies of somatosensory cortex organization in a variety of mammals, indicates that anterior parietal fields other than SI existed early in mammalian evolution, and were present in the common ancestor of all mammals.</AbstractText></Citation></Article>

Neurol. 416 291â308, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The nuclei of the hypothalamus and their circuitry are responsible for the integration of endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses, which ensure homeostasis of the organism Swanson, 1987 Swaab, 1997 . There are numerous neuropeptides, hormones, and releasing factors found selectively within the discrete nuclei of the hypo-thalamus Swanson, 1987 Liposits, 1993 Swaab, 1997 . Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript CART Douglas et al., 1995 has been identified recently as the third most abundant mRNA in the rat hypothalamus after subtraction of cerebellar and hippocampal mRNAs Gautvik et al., 1996 . Moreover, CART peptides have been found in discrete nuclei throughout the rat brain, includ-ing the hypothalamus Koylu et al., 1997, 1998 . Many hypothalamic nuclei, such as the paraventricular nucleus PVN , lateral hypothalamus LH , and arcuate nucleus ARC , which are enriched in CART and CART peptides Douglass et al., 1995 Koylu et al., 1997, 1998 , play a major role in regulating feeding behavior. Interestingly, recent data have shown that intracerebroventricular i.c.v. injection of CART peptides produces a dramatic decrease in the feeding response in rats Lambert et al., 1997, 1998 Kristensen et al., 1998 Thim et al., 1998 Kuhar and Dall Vechia, 1999 Lambert and Couceyro, 1999 . The PVN is a powerful neuroendocrine center. It modu-lates activity in the anterior and posterior pituitary as well as brainstem and spinal cord nuclei involved in autonomic functions Swanson,1987 Liposits,1993 Swaab,1997 .Among many of its neuroendocrine functions, the PVN mediates feeding behavior Gold, 1973 and it is considered a site of action for neuropeptideY NPY in its ability to stimulate food intake in rats Stanley and Leibowitz, 1985 Hakanison et al., 1998 . CART peptides, coadministered i.c.v. with NPY, signifi-cantly decrease the powerful stimulating effects of NPY on feeding Lambert et al., 1998 Kristensen et al., 1998 . Due to the interactions of CART peptides with NPY on feeding behavior and recent findings that show an interac-tion of CART peptides with leptin Kristensen et al., 1998 Elias et al., 1999 , it is important to elucidate the CART-NPY interactions in the PVN in the context of a physiological effect of leptin to decrease food intake by means of the arcuate nucleus. Thus, to better understand the potential role of CART peptides in neuroendocrine functions, auto-nomic functions, or both, the first goal of the present study was to elucidate the localization of CART peptide immuno-reactivityinthemonkeyhypothalamusandpituitary.Further-more,wecharacterizedtheultrastructuralfeaturesandsynap-tic connectivity of CART peptideâimmunoreactive CARTir elements in the PVN, and determined whether they re-ceive synaptic inputs from NPY-containing terminals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and preparation of tissue Eight adult rhesus monkeys were used in this study. After deep anesthesia with an overdose of pentobarbital, the animals were perfusion-fixed with a cold Ringerâs solution and a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer PB 0.1 M, pH 7.4 . The anesthesia and perfusion of the animals were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 1996 and the Emory University Animal Care and Use Committee. The brains and pituitaries were then cut in 60-Î¼m-thick sections with vibrating and freezing micro-tomes and processed for the immunohistochemical localiza-tion of CART peptide immunoreactivity at the light and electron microscope levels. Another series of sections were prepared for light and electron microscope double-immuno-labeling studies of CART peptides and NPY. CART peptide immunostaining Koylu et al., 1997 , polyclonal antisera were generated against five different CART peptide fragments. The CART peptide antibodies were prepared by Cocalico, Inc. Ream-stown, PA by using standard procedures. One of the antisera C4 79â102 between the last two pair of basic amino acids and the C-terminus , which has been found to give the most intense immunostaining in the rat and monkey brain Koylu et al., 1998 Smith et al., 1999 , was used in the present study. Details about the synthesis and specificity of this antiserum are described elsewhere Koylu et al., 1997 . Moreover, the specificity of the C4 antiserum on monkey tissue was ascertained by incubations in preim-mune serum or antiserum that has been preabsorbed with the C4 peptide fragment see Smith et al. 1997, 1999 . In both cases, staining was completely abolished. Conversely, preabsorption of the antiserum with any of the other CART peptide fragments did not have an effect on the intensity or distribution of immunostaining. processed for light microscope observations were pre-treated with sodium borohydride 1% in phosphate buff-ered saline [PBS], 0.01 M, pH 7.4 for 20 minutes, and preincubated with 1% normal goat serum NGS Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA , 1% bovine serum albumin BSA Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO , and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. They were then incubated at 4Â°C for 48 hours in the primary CART peptide antibody solution 1 5,000 in PBS 1% NGS 1% BSA 0.4% Triton X-100 . The sections were then washed in PBS and incu-bated for 90 minutes at room temperature with biotinyl-ated goat anti-rabbit IgGs Vector Laboratories 1 200 in PBS 1% BSA 1% NGS 0.4% Triton X-100 followed by a 90-minute incubation in the avidin-biotin peroxidase com-plex ABC Vector Laboratories 1 100 dilution in PBS 1% BSA . Then, sections were washed in PBS and TRIS buffer 0.05 M, pH 7.6 before a 10-minute incubation in 3,38-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride DAB, 0.025% Sigma , 0.01 M imidazole Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA and 0.006% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by repeated washes in PBS. Some of these sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, and a coverslip was applied with Permount. from four monkeys was used for the electron microscope analysis. After sectioning on the vibrating microtome, these sections were cryoprotected in 25% sucrose and 10% glycerol for 20 minutes before being frozen at 280Â°C for 20 minutes. They were then washed in PBS and processed for CART peptide immunostaining in the same way as the sections for light microscopy see above except that Triton X-100 was not used. Processing of tissue for electron microscopy The sections prepared for electron microscopy were washed in PB 0.1 M, pH 7.4 before post-fixation in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution in PB for 20 minutes. Then, they were washed in PB 0.1 M, pH 7.4 and dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol and propylene oxide. Uranyl acetate 1% was added to the 70% ethanol and incubated for 30 minutes to improve the contrast at the electron microscope. The sections were then embedded in resin Durcupan, ACM, Fluka on microscope slides and put in a 60Â°C oven for 48 hours. After examination at the light microscope, regions of interest in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus were cut out from the slides and glued on top of resin blocks with cyanoacrylate glue. Ultrathin sections were then cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut T ultramicrotome and collected on Pioloform-coated single slot copper grids. Some were stained with lead citrate Reynolds, 1963 and examined with a Zeiss EM 10C electron microscope. Double immunolabeling for CART peptide and NPY at the light microscope level In another series of sections, NPY immunostaining was revealed with DAB in a manner similar to that described above for CART peptide immunostaining. They were first incubated overnight at 4Â°C in the primary polyclonal sheep antiserum solution against NPY Chemicon Interna-tional, Inc, Temecula, CA, 1 3,500 in PBS 0.4% Triton X-100, 1% BSA and1% NGS . This step was followed by a 90-minute incubation in biotinylated donkey anti-sheep IgGs Sigma, 1 50 in PBS 1% NGS 1% BSA and ABC 1 100 and PBS 1% BSA . The product of the ABC reaction was revealed with DAB as described above. The reaction was stopped by many washes in PBS. These NPY-immunostained sections were next pro-cessed for CART peptide immunostaining according to a procedure identical to that described above, except that the sections were revealed with nickel-enhanced DAB Ni-DAB , instead of DAB. The Ni-DAB was revealed as follows After washes in PBS and TRIS buffer, sections were incubated for 10 minutes in a mixture of DAB 0.025% Sigma , ammonium nickel sulfate Ni-DAB Fischer Scien-tific 0.35% , and 0.0006% hydrogen peroxide Hancock, 1982 Wouterlood et al., 1987 . The reaction was stopped by repeated washes in PBS. The sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, and a cover-slip was applied with Permount. Control experiments. As controls, a series of sections were processed for CART peptide or NPY immunostaining alone. Another series of sections were processed according to the double immunostaining protocol except that each of the primary antibodies were omitted in turn from the incubation solutions. The distribution and quality of the immunostaining for CART peptide and NPY in the single-stained sections was comparable to that obtained after double immunostaining. This finding indicates that there was no loss of immunoreactivity due to the double- immunostaining procedure. After omission of each pri-mary antisera, sections were stained with either only Ni-DAB when the NPY antiserum was omitted, or only DAB when the CART peptide antiserum was omitted. Irrespective of the chromogen used, the pattern of staining for each antisera corresponded to that seen in single-stained sections, indicating there was no nonspecific stain-ing generated by potential cross-reactions between the two chromogens. Double immunostaining for CART peptide and NPY at the electron microscope level A series of sections including the PVN were used for double labeling of CART peptide and NPY at the electron microscope level. NPY was revealed first with DAB and CART peptide was then localized with tetramethylbenzi-dine TMB Llewellyn-Smith et al., 1993 Sidibe and Smith, 1996 .After borohydride treatment, cryoprotection, and freezing at 280Â°C see above , these sections were preincubated for 1 hour with PBS containing 1% NGS and 1% BSA. They were then incubated overnight at 4Â°C with the sheep anti-NPY antiserum 1 3,500 , followed by 90-minute incubations in biotinylated donkey anti-sheep IgGs and ABC as described above. The NPY immunoreactivity was localized with DAB as described above. The sections were then incubated for 48 hours with rabbit anti-CART IgGs C4 fragment, 1 5,000 dilution at 4Â°C followed by a 90-minute incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgGs and then ABC as described above. The sections were washed three to five times in PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 before revealing the CART peptide immunoreactivity with the tungstate-stabilized TMB method Llewellyn-Smith et al., 1993 as follows sections were preincubated for 20 min-utes in a solution of TMB prepared according to the protocol of Llewellyn-Smith et al. 1993 . After preincuba-tion, the reaction was initiated with the addition of glucose oxidase to a final concentration of 0.1% in a fresh TMB solution. The reaction was stopped after 5â7 minutes by extensive washes in PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 . The TMB reaction product was then stabilized with DAB according to the protocol of Rye et al. 1984 . As controls, the NPY or CART peptide antibodies were omitted in turn from the incubation solutions. This method led to DAB-labeled terminals only when CART peptide antibodies were omitted, whereas only crystals of TMB were found after omission of the NPY antiserum. In both cases, the overall pattern of staining was similar to that obtained in single-labeling experiments with the respec-tive antibodies. Analysis of material To illustrate the distribution of CART peptideâimmuno-reactive elements, three sections that correspond to the rostral, middle, and caudal thirds of the monkey hypothala-mus were drawn with a camera lucida at 1.63. The immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were then repre-sented by dots and sinuous lines, respectively. The nomen-clature of hypothalamic nuclei comes from the atlas of Bleier 1984 . Analysis of the ultrastructural features and synaptic connectivity of CARTir elements in the PVN was per-formed. Sections were randomly scanned for the presence of CART peptideâcontaining neurons in both the lateral and medial PVN. CARTir dendrites and perikarya were categorized as neurosecretory or not, based on the presence or absence of dense core vesicles, respectively. Synaptic in- puts to CARTir elements were subsequently characterized, based primarily on the type of synaptic contact formed symmetric vs. asymmetric and morphologic criteria. To study the synaptic relationships between the CARTir neurons and NPY-containing terminals, four blocks were taken from dense areas of overlap in the medial and lateral PVN. To ascertain that the areas of analysis contained both reaction products, ultrathin sections were collected from the surface of the blocks where the TMB and DAB staining were optimum. Sections were randomly scanned for the presence of NPY-containing terminals in areas of CARTir elements. In cases where the NPY-immunoreac-tive boutons were apposed to the surface of CART peptideâ containing neurons, they were followed in three to five serial sections to verify whether these appositions ended up in synaptic contacts Fig. 12 . DISCUSSION The present study provides the first description of CART peptide immunoreactivity in the monkey hypothalamus. In keeping with recent data showing that CART is one of the most abundant mRNA in the rat hypothalamus Gaut-vik et al., 1996 , our immunocytochemical findings demon-strate that CARTir neuronal cell bodies and axon termi-nals are widely distributed throughout the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus in monkeys. The main findings of our study are 1 the most intensely labeled CARTir regions include the paraventricular, supra-optic, infundibular, and premammillary nuclei, whereas the posterior, anterior, and lateral hypothalamic areas display moderate CART peptide immunoreactivity 2 in the PVN, both large secretory and small non-neurosecre-tory neurons display CART peptide immunoreactivity 3 the posterior pituitary is densely innervated by CARTir terminals, which strongly suggest that CART peptide is transported along axons of magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the PVN and supraoptic nucleus 4 the external palisade zone of the median eminence contains rich plexusesof CARTir varicosities, which indicates that CART peptide might also be transported along axons of parvocel-lular neurosecretory neurons to the hypophyseal portal system which, then, carries it to the anterior pituitary AP 5 both secretory and non-neurosecretory CARTir neurons in the PVN display a similar pattern of synaptic innervation, being contacted predominantly by non- immunoreactive terminals forming asymmetric synapses 6 The PVN is enriched in CARTir terminals that contain intensely stained dense-core vesicles and form asymmetric synapses predominantly with non-neurosecretory den-drites and 7 CARTir neurons and NPY-containing termi-nals largely overlap and are apposed to each other in the medial part of the PVN. In the following account, these observations will be discussed in the light of previous ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and hodologic stud-ies of the PVN, and the potential roles of CART peptides in the control of neuroendocrine and autonomic functions will be examined. Overall, the pattern of distribution of CARTir neuronal cell bodies shown in this study is largely congruent with that recently described in rats by using in situ hybridiza-tion Douglass et al., 1995 and light microscopy immuno-histochemistry Koylu et al., 1997, 1998 . However, our data show that, in addition to CARTir neuronal perikarya, some nuclei in the monkey hypothalamus PVN, SON, IN, PA, Pem contained rich plexuses of CARTir terminal-like varicosities. Ultrastructural studies of the PVN confirmed that CARTir axon terminals were, indeed, found in this nucleus and, in addition, that the immunoreactivity was particularly intense over dense-core vesicles, suggesting that they may be the major storage sites of CART peptides in these terminals. Similar findings were recently found in the nucleus accumbens in monkeys where CART peptide coexists with g-aminobutyric acid GABA in intrinsic striatal terminals Smith et al., 1997, 1999 .An interesting feature about the distribution of the CART peptide is its abundance throughout the whole extent of the hypothala-mus, which is consistent with polymerase chain reaction studies Gautvik et al., 1996 showing that CART is the third most abundant mRNA in the rat hypothalamus after subtraction of transcripts found in the cerebellum and hippocampus. This widespread distribution strongly sug-gests that CART peptides coexist with other neuropep- tides, neurotransmitters, or both, and play important roles in various endocrine and autonomic functions of the pri-mate hypothalamus see below . Phenotype of CARTir neurons in the monkey PVN In the PVN, CART peptide immunoreactivity was found in large and small neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axon terminals. In the electron microscope, both secretory and non-neurosecretory neurons were immunoreactive, which is in line with recent findings in rats showing that neurons in both the magnocellular and parvocellular parts of the PVN display CART peptide immunoreactivity Koylu et al., 1997 and express CART mRNA Douglass et al., 1995 . A major difference between our data and those obtained in rats relates to the staining of fibers leaving the PVN and SON to the pituitary. Whereas the pattern of CARTir fibers depicted in the present study strikingly resembled that of vasopressin-labeled fibers, oxytocin-labeled fibers, or both, described previously in rats and monkeys Kawata and Sano, 1982 Swanson, 1987 Wang et al., 1997 , such is not the case in rats where the CART peptide immunostaining is largely confined to neuronal perikarya Koylu et al., 1997 . Because the study by Koylu was carried out in animals treated with colchicine, which interferes with the transport of CART peptides along output fibers, we looked at the distribution of CART peptides in the hypothalamus of three normal rats to compare with the labeling in normal monkeys. Surpris-ingly, we found that the overall pattern of fiber staining from the PVN was not different between normal and colchicine-treated rats data not shown , despite that the level of CART peptide immunoreactivity in cell bodies was much lower in normal than treated animals. Altogether, these observations suggest a potential species difference in the turnover of CART peptides in neurosecretory PVN neurons between rats and monkeys. Another possibility is that the basal levels of CART peptides in the PVN are higher in monkeys than rats. It is worth noting that a low level of expression, under basal conditions, seems to be common for many peptides that coexist with vasopressin and oxytocin in the rat PVN Swanson, 1987 . It is well established that vasopressin and oxytocin are largely segregated into two different neuronal populations in the PVN and SON Swanson, 1987 Liposits, 1993 Ginsberg et al., 1994 . Whether CART peptides coexist with vasopressin, oxytocin, or both peptides remains to be established by colocalization studies. However, an ana-containing neurons in the PVN and SON in monkeys is the tomic feature that differentiates vasopressin-from oxytocin- mode of origin of their axons. The axons of oxytocin neurons arises predominantly from cell bodies, whereas, those of vasopressin neurons arise from proximal den-drites Kawata and Sano, 1982 . That we found CARTir axons emerging from proximal dendrites of large PVN neurons indicate that, at least, some of the CARTir neurons in the PVN contain vasopressin. In addition to being expressed in large neurosecretory neurons, CART peptide immunoreactivity was also found in subpopulations of so-called parvocellular neurons in the monkey PVN. It is difficult to speculate about the func-tional significance of these data because of the extremely complex and heterogeneous chemistry of parvocellular PVN neurons Swanson, 1987 Liposits, 1993 . This is further complicated by the fact that those neurons not only project to the median eminence but also provide major inputs to various brainstem and spinal nuclei involved in autonomic functions Armstrong et al., 1993 Liposits, 1993 . On the basis of the pattern of distribution of CARTir fibers described in this study, it seems that parvocellular PVN neurons send axonal projections to both the parvocel-lular neurosecretory system and autonomic centers in the brainstem and spinal cord. Our data, indeed, showed that the external palisade zone of the median eminence, which contains terminals from hypothalamic neurons that send their content into the hypophyseal portal system Swan-son, 1987 McKinley and Oldfield, 1990 , was enriched in CARTir varicosities. Although the exact location of hypo-thalamic neurons that give rise to these terminals remains to be established, these observations indicate that CART peptides probably coexist with hypophysiotropic releasing factors to control the secretion and release of hormones in the anterior pituitary. In contrast to findings in rats where a subpopulation of cells in the anterior pituitary express CART mRNA Couceyro et al., 1997 and display CART peptide immunoreactivity Koylu et al., 1997 , the anterior pituitary was completely devoid of immunostaining in monkeys. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that our analysis was carried out in normal monkeys, whereas rodent data were obtained in colchicine-treated animals Koylu et al., 1997 . It is, therefore, possible that the level of CART peptide immunoreactivity in cells of the anterior pituitary in monkeys was not high enough to be detected by immunocytochemistry. That the intensity of immunostaining in anterior pituitary cells was so low in rats, even after colchicine treatment see Fig. 6B in Koylu et al., 1997 , strongly supports this hypothesis.An alterna-tive explanation would be that rodents and primate differ in their CART peptide expression in anterior pituitary cells. On the other hand, some of the brainstem and spinal nuclei that are known to receive inputs from the PVN, i.e., the periaqueductal gray, the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, also contained rich plexuses of CARTir terminals in rats Koylu et al., 1998 and monkeys Dall Vechia and Smith, unpublished observations , which support the existence of CARTir hypothalamotegmental projections. Therefore, although colocalization studies and tract-tracing experiments are essential to further charac-terize the phenotype and hodology of CARTir neurons in the primate PVN, our immunocytochemical data combined with those in rodents strongly suggest that CART peptides are expressed in PVN neurons involved in both neuroendo-crine and autonomic functions. Both secretory and non-neurosecretory CARTir neurons received dense asymmetric synaptic inputs, whereas sym-metric synapses were much less numerous and largely confined to perikarya. Although it is premature to specu-late about the source of these terminals, it is likely that most boutons forming asymmetric synapses contain gluta-mate, known as the main transmitter of synaptic afferents to the PVN van den Pol, 1991 Decavel and van den Pol, 1992 Goldsmith et al., 1994 Thind and Goldsmith, 1995 . Future tract-tracing studies combined with pre-and postembedding immunocytochemistry for glutamate and CART peptides are essential to further characterize this issue. Source s of CARTir terminals in the PVN Apopulation of CARTir terminals that formed asymmet-ric synapses predominantly with small non-neurosecre-tory dendrites was found in the monkey PVN. The ultra-structural features and synaptic specialization of these CARTir terminals resemble those of glutamate-enriched boutons described in previous studies van den Pol et al., 1990 DeCavel and van den Pol, 1992 Goldsmith et al., 1994 Thind and Goldsmith, 1995 . In fact, glutamate and GABA account for the majority of presynaptic terminals in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus van den Pol et al., 1990 , and it is very likely that these fast neurotransmit-ters coexist with one or more neuroactive peptides. In this regard, it is worth noting that the CARTir terminals visualized in the PVN contained a few darkly stained dense-core vesicles, a feature commonly described for glutamate-enriched boutons in rats and monkeys Decavel and van den Pol, 1992 Goldsmith et al., 1994 Thind and Goldsmith, 1995 . Moreover, some of these labeled dense-core vesicles were aggregated at the active zones, suggest-ing synaptic corelease of CART peptides and glutamate from individual terminals. Whether these putative CART peptide glutamate-enriched boutons arise from intrinsic PVN neurons Goldsmith et al., 1994 or extrinsic sources remains to be established. Another potential source of CARTir terminals in the PVN are noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. Various data support this possibility 1 neurosecretory and non-neurosecretory PVN neurons receive dense norad-renergic inputs from the locus coeruleus Swanson, 1987 Ginsberg et al., 1994 , 2 noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus express CART peptide immunoreactivity Koylu et al., 1999 , and 3 dopamine-b-hydroxylaseâ containing terminals in contact with PVN neurons display ultrastructural features and a pattern of synaptic innerva-tion that resemble CARTir boutons described in this study Silverman et al., 1985 Nakada and Nakai, 1985 Liposits et al., 1986 . However, a particular feature of CARTir boutons that is not consistent with those of noradrenergic terminals is that they form synapses exclusively with small dendrites devoid of neurosecretory vesicles. In con-trast, noradrenergic boutons innervate both neurosecre-tory and non-neurosecretory cells in the monkey PVN Swanson, 1987 Ginsberg et al., 1994 . Whether this indicates that CART peptide is expressed selectively in a subpopulation of noradrenergic neurons that innervate the non-neurosecretory PVN neurons remains to be estab-lished. Finally, many other structures including the infundibu-lar nucleus, central amygdaloid nucleus, and the septal nucleus, which are known to project to the PVN and contain CARTir neurons Koylu et al., 1997 , may be additional sources of terminals. However, the lack of information on the ultrastructural features of the boutons arising from these nuclei limit the interpretation regard-ing these PVN afferents. Relationships between CARTir neurons and NPY-containing terminals Despite the tight overlap between CARTir neurons and NPY-containing terminals at the light microscope level see also Lambert et al., 1998 , direct synaptic contacts could not be found in the electron microscope. In general, the NPY-positive boutons were in close proximity or ap- posed to CART peptideâlabeled elements but formed syn-apses with unlabelled dendrites. One of the conclusions of these anatomic data is that direct synaptic connections between NPY-and CART peptideâimmunoreactive ele-ments in the PVN are unlikely to underlie the functional interactions between CART peptides and NPY in regulat-ing feeding behaviors. However, because of various techni-cal issues, such as limited penetration of antibodies into the tissue, limited diffusion of CART peptides into distal dendrites, and short active zones associated with NPY synapses Liposits et al., 1988 Sawchenko and Pfeiffer, 1988 , care must be taken in interpreting these negative electron microscope observations. We tried to circumvent these problems by selecting tissue from the surface of the sections where the penetration of both antibodies was optimum. We also paid particular attention to examining the NPY-containing terminals in serial ultrathin sections so that we could identify short active zones. However, even under such conditions, we cannot rule out the possibility that some distal dendrites contacted by NPY-immunoreac-tive boutons might have been immunonegative for CART peptide because of the limited sensitivity of the immunocy-tochemical procedure to label distal processes. Although such might be the case, it is worth noting that a large proportion of NPY-containing boutons were found to estab-lish synaptic contacts with the perikarya and proximal dendrites of PVN neurons in rats Sawchenko and Pfeiffer, 1988 . Furthermore, in the few instances where NPY boutons contacted distal dendrites, they mostly formed symmetric synapses Sawchenko and Pfeiffer, 1988 . If such is also the case in primates, these data, combined with those of the present study, showing that almost 90% of the terminals in contact with small CARTir dendrites form asymmetric synapses suggest that distal CARTir dendrites are unlikely to receive strong NPY innervation. Another potential source of false-negative findings might be that the short active zones of the NPY-positive synapses on CARTir neurons have been missed in the series of ultrathin sections analyzed. Indeed, although NPY-immunoreactive terminals have been examined through 3â5 sections i.e., 210â350 nm , this is considerably less than the diameter of most NPY-positive boutons Saw-chenko and Pfeiffer, 1988 Kagotani et al., 1989 . Of course, the fact that we did not find direct synaptic connections between these two neuropeptide-containing elements does not rule out the possibility of any functional interactions between CART and NPY at the level of the PVN. The mechanism by which these peptides are released and mediate their effects upon their targets is largely un-known. The possibility of nonsynaptic release of NPY and activation of extrasynaptic receptors on CARTir neurons definitely deserves attention as well as the fact that CARTir neurons and NPY terminals might interact in other hypothalamic nuclei and, possibly, extrahypotha-lamic sites to regulate feeding behaviors Hernandez and Hoebel, 1988 Bakshi and Kelley, 1993 Stratford and Kelley, 1997 Elmquist et al., 1998 . RESULTS The distribution of CART peptide immunostaining in the rostral, middle, and caudal thirds of the hypothalamus of macaque monkey is illustrated in Figures 1â3. Overall, the pattern of distribution of CARTir neurons in the monkey hypothalamus is in keeping with that recently observed in rats with the same antibodies Koylu et al., 1997 . The supraoptic SON , paraventricular PVN , periven-tricular Pet , infundibular IN , and premamillary Pem nuclei and the posterior nucleus were the most intensely labeled structures, whereas the lateral hypothalamus LH , anterior hypothalamic area and posterior hypotha-lamic area PA displayed a moderate immunostaining Figs. 1â3 . On the other hand, the alar AL and ventrome-dial VM nuclei were very lightly stained Figs. 2A, 4A . The mammillary bodies MB were almost completely devoid of immunostaining except for a small plexus of immunoreactive fibers that arborized in the ventral part of the nucleus just above the mammillary peduncle mp Fig. 3A,B . Apart from the SON and PVN, which con-tained numerous immunoreactive perikarya and dendritic processes, the other labeled nuclei were mostly enriched in immunoreactive fibers and varicosities, among which were found a small to moderate number of labeled cell bodies Figs. 1â4 . The neuropil staining was particularly intense in the infundibular nucleus IN where medium-sized 18â25 Î¼m in diameter immunoreactive perikarya were enmeshed in a rich network of labeled varicosities Fig. 2A,C,D . In the median eminence ME , rich plexuses of small varicosities arborized profusely in the external palisade zone, whereas the internal fibrous zone was densely packed with large axon-like processes Fig. 2B . In the SON and PVN, neuronal perikarya of various sizes 12â30 Î¼m in diameter were intermingled with labeled varicosities along the entire extent of the nuclei Figs. 1A,B, 2A, 4 . In the PVN, the density of labeled varicosities was higher medially along the edge of the third ventricle in an area corresponding to the periventricular part of the nucleus Figs. 2A, 4A . Large bundles of CART peptideâimmunoreactive fibers arose from the PVN and SON and followed a trajectory similar to that of vasopres-sin-immunoreactive fibers previously described in rats and monkeys Kawata and Sano, 1982 Swanson, 1987 Wang et al., 1997 . In brief, CARTir fibers from the PVN arched laterally and then ventrally to the dorsal surface of the optic tract where they were joined by immunoreactive fibers from the SON. Together they continued medially to the infundibulum Inf ventral to the third ventricle Figs. 1A,B, 2A, 4A,C . At high magnification, fibers leaving the PVN were found to arise from large proximal dendrites, which became thinner and varicose as they exit the nucleus Fig. 4C . At the level of the pituitary, the posterior lobe was densely filled with CARTir varicosities which, in some cases, were apposed to immunoreactive pituicytes. On the other hand, the anterior and intermediate IP lobes were devoid of CART peptide immunostaining Fig. 5 . electron microscope level, the CART peptide immunostain-ing in the PVN was confined to neuronal somata, den-drites, small unmyelinated axons and terminals, whereas dendritic spines and glial cells were devoid of immunoreac-tivity Figs. 6â10 . Consistent with light microscopic obser-vations, two types of CARTir somata were found in the lateral and medial PVN. The first type was smaller 12â15 Î¼m , contained a large oval nucleus with multiple cytoplas-mic intrusions and a cytoplasm devoid of neurosecretory granules Fig. 6 . The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus displayed strong immunostaining in these peri-karya Fig. 6 . The second type was much larger 25â35 Î¼m , contained a slightly indented oval nucleus and a cytoplasm particularly enriched in rough endoplasmic reticulum as well as immunostained and nonimmunos-tained, large neurosecretory granules. The primary den-drites contained the same set of organelles as the peri-karyal cytoplasm, but also possessed neurotubules Fig. 7 . neurons. In general, the pattern of innervation of CARTir perikarya and dendrites was relatively similar irrespec-tive of the presence or not of neurosecretory granules and their localization in the nucleus. Most terminals in contact with CARTir dendrites formed asymmetric synapses, but cell bodies also received significant symmetric synaptic inputs Fig. 9 . The majority of terminals forming asymmet-ric synapses varied in size from 0.7â1.5 Î¼m in diameter and usually contained mitochondria and dense aggregates of small electron-lucent vesicles at the active zones Figs. 7B, 8A,B . Some of these boutons also contained numerous dense-core vesicles Fig. 8C . The terminals forming sym-metric synapses were medium in size 0.7â1.2 Î¼m in diameter and densely packed with numerous pleomorphic electron-lucent vesicles Fig. 8D . Although these boutons were rarely found on dendrites, they accounted for 20â25% of the synaptic inputs to the CARTir perikarya Fig. 9 . CART peptideâimmunoreactive terminals. Electron microscope analysis of 115 CART peptideâimmunoreactive terminals randomly distributed throughout the whole extent of the PVN, revealed that these boutons belong to a single population characterized by a small to medium size 0.4â1.0 Î¼m in diameter and a dense content in small round electron-lucent vesicles among which were inter-spersed a few darkly stained dense-core vesicles and one or two mitochondria Fig. 10 . In most instances, the dense-core vesicles were found at nonsynaptic sites along the edge of the labeled boutons, although occasionally they aggregated at active zones Fig. 10B . In the 40 cases where the sections were cut in the appropriate plane to visualize the synaptic specialization, it was of the asymmet-ric type. Thirty-nine of these terminals were in contact with small non-neurosecretory dendrites irrespective of their localization within the nucleus Fig. 10 . Two of these dendrites also displayed CART peptide immunostaining Fig. 10A . In one instance, two CARTir terminals formed asymmetric synaptic contact with an unlabelled dendritic spine Fig. 10C . Due to the opposite effects of CART peptides and NPY in the control of feeding in rats Lambert et al., 1997, 1998 Kristensen et al., 1998 and the importance of the PVN in regulating feeding behavior Stanley and Leibowitz, 1985 Elmquist et al., 1998 , we studied the synaptic relation-ships between CARTir neurons and NPY-containing termi-nals in the monkey PVN. In sections prepared for light microscopic observations, DAB was used to reveal NPY immunoreactivity brown amorphous deposit , whereas Ni-DAB served as chromogen for localizing CART peptide immunostaining dark blue amorphous deposit . Overall, the pattern of distribution of CARTir neurons in these double-immunostained sections was not different from that described above after single CART peptide immuno-staining Fig. 11A . On the other hand, the NPY immuno-reactivity was confined to a large number of varicosities, which occurred preferentially in the medial two-thirds of the nucleus Fig. 11A . In areas of overlap, the dendrites and perikarya of CARTir neurons were occasionally ap-posed to NPY-immunoreactive varicose processes, suggest- ing the possibility of synaptic contacts between these elements Fig. 11B . To test this possibility, we prepared a series of sections for the simultaneous localization of CARTir neurons and NPY-containing boutons at the electron microscope level. In those sections, CART peptide was localized with TMB, which resulted in a crystalline reaction product, whereas NPY immunostaining was revealed with DAB, which led to an amorphous deposit Figs. 12, 13 . At the light microscope level, the pattern of distribution of the CART peptide TMB-labeled and NPY-immunoreac-tive DAB-labeled elements in the PVN was the same as that disclosed in DAB Ni-DAB sections. As shown in Figures 12 and 13, both reaction products were easily distinguishable in the electron microscope. The crystals of TMB were distributed in a pattern congruent with that of CART peptide immunoreactivity described above, whereas the DAB deposit was found exclusively in terminals and small unmyelinated axons, which is in keeping with previous electron microscopic studies of NPY immunoreactivity in the rat PVN Pelletier et al., 1984 Sawchenko and Pfeiffer, 1988 Kagotani et al., 1989 . A total of 52 NPY-positive terminals in the vicinity less than 2 Î¼m away of CARTir neurons were followed in three to five serial sections to verify the possibility of direct synaptic contacts between NPY-immunoreactive termi-nals and CARTir neurons. None of the boutons examined established clear synapses with CARTir neurons, not even in the cases where the NPY-positive boutons were tightly apposed to CARTir dendrites or perikarya Fig. 12 . Most NPY-positive terminals rather formed symmetric or asym-metric synapses with nonimmunoreactive dendrites Figs. 12E, 13A . In one case, a puncta adherentia was found between a CARTir perikaryon and a NPY-positive bouton Fig. 13B . Concluding remarks In summary, our findings show that CART peptide is widely distributed throughout the primate hypothalamus where it probably coexists with other neuropeptides and transmitters involved in various neuroendocrine and auto-nomic functions. Of particular interest is the fact that CART peptide is expressed and transported to the poste- rior pituitary by magnocellular neurosecretory hypotha-lamic neurons and, possibly, released in the anterior pituitary by the hypophyseal portal system. This empha-sizes the possibility that CART peptide plays major regula-tory functions, not only in the central nervous system but also in the periphery, which is in line with recent data showing that CART peptide is expressed in the adrenal gland Koylu et al., 1997 and the gastrointestinal tract Couceyro et al., 1998 in rats. CART cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript was originally chosen as the name of this peptide because of its striatal up-regulation after challenging rats with psychomotor stimulants. The findings of the present study and those published over the past year clearly indicate that the functions of CART peptides as putative neurotrans-mitters neuromodulators in the central and peripheral nervous system are likely to be very complex and multi-farious.

Neurol. 416 309â318, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Recent studies strongly suggest a role for neurotrophins in regulating synaptic function in both developing and adult animals reviewed by Thoenen, 1995 Lo, 1998 McAllister et al., 1999 . Synapses made by motoneurons with muscle in the periphery, as well as synapses made with motoneurons by primary afferents in the spinal cord, are responsive to neurotrophins during development and in adulthood. For example, transmission at neuromuscu-lar synapses made in culture is modified by the neurotroph-ins NT-3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF , and NT-4 Lohof et al., 1993 Wang et al., 1998 . Also, the excitatory potentials produced at the synapses between motoneurons and group Ia muscle spindle afferents Ia-MN synapses change in size in response to manipulation of the neurotrophins NT-3 and BDNF in adult and develop-ing rats Munson et al., 1997 Mendell et al., 1999 Seebach et al., 1999 . The endogenous source s of neurotrophins that may affect motoneuron synapses is not yet determined, but the expression of neurotrophins by muscle Funakoshi et al., 1993 Griesbeck et al., 1995 draws attention to the muscle as the target-derived source of neurotrophin for motoneu-rons. It is increasingly apparent, however, that neurons depending on or influenced by a specific neurotrophin may also express that neurotrophin, suggesting that these factors may influence neuronal properties including synap-tic transmission in an autocrine or paracrine manner Lu et al., 1989 Schecterson and Bothwell, 1992 Acheson et al., 1995 . RNase protection studies reporting expression of NT-3, NT-4, and BDNF in adult rat spinal cord support the possibility of motoneuron synthesis of neurotrophins Fu-nakoshi et al., 1993, 1995 Griesbeck et al., 1995 Yama-moto et al., 1996 . BDNF mRNAhas been localized to adult rat facial and spinal motoneurons Kobayashi et al., 1996 Li et al., 1997 , although others do not to detect this message in adult rat motoneurons Ernfors et al., 1990 Yan et al., 1997b . NT-3 mRNA has recently been localized to adult mouse cervical motoneurons with single-cell re- verse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR Junier et al., 1998 . The localization of NT-4 mRNA, on the other hand, has not been reported in the spinal cord. To specifically determine whether rat lumbosacral spi-nal cord motoneurons express neurotrophins implicated in synaptic development and plasticity, we used a sensitive in situ hybridization protocol to examine the cellular expres-sion of mRNA for each of these neurotrophins in develop-ing and adult rat spinal motoneurons. Results of these studies show that in the neonatal spinal cord, motoneu-rons do not express detectable levels of either NT-4 or BDNF mRNA, but NT-3 mRNA is readily apparent in neonatal motoneurons. Late in the first postnatal week, BDNF mRNA expression is detected in motoneurons, whereas NT-4 mRNA first appears in this population at postnatal day 9. Most adult motoneurons express mRNA encoding either BDNF or NT-4, fewer adult motoneurons apparently express NT-3 mRNA. A substantial fraction of adult motoneurons express the mRNAs for both NT-4 and BDNF. The potential functional significance of expression of these neurotrophin mRNAs in adult motoneurons is supported by immunohistochemical localization of these proteins within motoneurons of the adult rat spinal cord. Some of these results have been reported in abstract form Buck et al., 1998 Buck and Cope, 1999 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal preparation Sprague-Dawley rats were used for these studies. For developmental stages, the day of vaginal plug was consid-ered embryonic day 0 E0 and birth typically occurred at E22, which was also considered to be postnatal day 0 P0 . Adult animals in this study weighed 300â350 g. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital 70 mg kg before transcardial perfusion with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.6. The lumbar spinal cord was removed, post-fixed for 2â4 hours at 4Â°C and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline PBS, pH 7.3 at 4Â°C overnight. Tissue was embedded in cryoprotective media Tissue Tek O.C.T and frozen on a microtome chuck over dry ice. Serial frozen sections were cut at 8â12 microns for comparison of gene expression in the same motoneurons on adjacent sections. Sections were thaw mounted on Superfrost plus Fisher Scientific slides and frozen at 220Â°C for up to 1 month. Before use for either in situ hybridization ISH or immunohistochemis-try IHC , sections were thawed at room temperature and allowed to dry completely to facilitate adherence of the sections to the slides. The Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal re-search protocols used in this study. Identification and counting of motoneurons Motoneurons were provisionally identified in spinal cord cross-sections as relatively large multipolar cells in the ventral horn with distinct nuclei. The validity of these criteria for adult rats was verified in two animals by showing that ventral horn neurons with these morphologic features invariably stained positive for the motoneuron-specific antigen recognized by the MO-1 monoclonal anti-body Urakami and Chiu, 1990 . Neuron size and presence of a nucleus were readily determinable in sections stained both for cresyl violet and for neurotrophin in situ hybridiza-tion. Because of the intense staining of the cytoplasm obtained with our neurotrophin probes, together with low background staining, those cells that stained positive for a probe were readily distinguishable by visual inspection by multiple examiners. This subjective evaluation was biased toward exclusion of cells with positive but indistinct staining. Quantitative analyses of the cross-sections from adult spinal cords were performed on a Zeiss Axiophot micro-scope with a computer-controlled stage equipped with Image Pro Plus 3.0 and or Image-1 software. For cells meeting our criteria for motoneurons, including the re-quired presence of a distinct nucleus, the maximal diam-eter of a subjectively determined best-fit ellipse was taken as the cell diameter. Those cells with diameters exceeding 35 Î¼m were considered a-motoneurons cf. Swett et al., 1986 . For each stain, motoneurons with distinct nuclei average diameter 16.3 Î¼m were counted in 10-Î¼m sec-tions in both right and left ventral horns throughout L4 and L5. The equation of Abercrombie 1946 was used to correct for overestimation introduced by the double-counting error Guillery and Herrup, 1997 . For early postnatal developmental studies, the largest cells of the ventral horn with distinct multipolar morphol-ogy were provisionally identified as motoneurons. Cell counts were not undertaken for the developmental studies. Fluoro-Gold retrograde labeling of motoneurons In one adult rat, motoneurons were labeled unilaterally by injection of a 5% solution of the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold Colorado scientific into the left lateral gas-trocnemius muscle 50 Î¼l injected at each of three sites . Three days after injection of the tracer, the animal was perfused and processed for frozen sectioning as described above. In situ hybridization Nonradioactive single-stranded RNA cRNA probes were used for in situ hybridization ISH . Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR by using PCR prim-ers unique to the gene of interest was used to generate template DNA for specific neurotrophin cRNA probes. RT-PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Pro-mega plasmid vector and single-stranded, digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense cRNAprobes were transcribed in vitro Ausubel et al., 1999 . The sequences used as neurotrophin mRNA probes are described in Table 1. We used a modification of published ISH protocols for these studies Schaeren-Wiemers and Gerfin-Moser, 1993 Ma et al., 1997 Schmitt et al., 1997 . Briefly, sections were permeabilized with proteinase K 1 Î¼g ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl and 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA , pH 8, 30 minutes at 37Â°C before prehybridization for 4 hours at 68Â°C in hybridization buffer 50% formamide, 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 5 mM EDTA, 13 Denhardtâs solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 10 mM dithiothreitol . Hybridization was carried out at 68Â°C overnight in the same buffer with 1 Î¼g ml digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe. The sections were washed for 10 minutes in 13 standard saline citrate SSC 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM NaC6H5O7, pH 7.0 and 10 minutes with 1.53 SSC at 60Â°C, followed by two washes at 37Â°C in 23 SSC for 20 minutes each. Sections were digested with 0.1 Î¼g ml RNAse A in 23 SSC at 37Â°C for 30 minutes, followed with two 10-minute washes in 23 SSC at room temperature and two 30-minute washes in 0.23 SSC at 60Â°C. After equilibration in maleic acid buffer 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5 , sections were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature and hybridization detected as suggested by the supplier of the anti-digoxigenin antibody Boehringer Mannheim . Sec-tions were incubated with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments 1 5,000 in blocking buffer Boehringer Mannheim , washed for 1 hour in maleic acid buffer and developed 4 hours to overnight in color development buffer 0.1 M Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.315 mg ml nitroblue tetrazolium, 0.175mg ml bromo-chloro-indoyl-phosphate . The color de-velopment reaction was terminated in neutralizing buffer 10 mM Tris, pH 5, 1 mM EDTA , slides were dehydrated through an alcohol series, cover-slipped in Permount Sigma , and viewed and photographed with a Leitz Ortho-plan 2 microscope. Color photographs were digitized on a flatbed scanner and imported to Adobe Photoshop for preparation of all figures. Controls for ISH studies included RNase treatment of control sections before hybridization, omission of the cRNA probe, hybridization with an excess of unlabeled antisense probe, and hybridization with corresponding sense strand probe. Each of these controls eliminated the specific signal. The cellular specificity and sensitivity of our nonradioac-tive protocol is supported by the overlapping but noniden-tical binding of different neurotrophin probes on adjacent sections, overlapping patterns of neurotrophin protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry Figs. 1, 3, 4 , and by localization of expression of cell type-specific neural genes [Ta1 tubulin and NeuN neuron-specific and GFAP astroglial-specific data not shown ]. Immunohistochemistry An antiâNT-4 monoclonal antibody Chemicon, Inc. raised to recombinant human NT-4 was used to localize rat NT-4 in spinal cord sections obtained as described above. Polyclonal antibodies to both recombinant BDNF and recombinant NT3 Chemicon, Inc. were used to detect these neurotrophins with immunohistochemistry. In some cases, 15% water-saturated picric acid was included in the perfusion and post-fixation steps, which resulted in an increase in signal intensity Junier et al., 1998 . Spinal cord sections were exposed to the primary antibody antiâ NT-4 diluted 1 100, anti-BDNF and antiâNT-3 diluted 1 500 in PBS pH 7.3 with 0.04% Triton X-100 PBST for 48 hours at 4Â°C. After thorough washes in PBST, sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with a biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1 500 in PBST Jackson ImmunoResearch , washed as above, and incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase complex and diaminobenzi-dine substrate as described by the supplier Vector Labora-tories ABC kit . Sections were washed, cover-slipped in Permount Sigma and viewed and photographed as de-scribed above. To demonstrate specificity, in separate control sections the primary or secondary antibodies were omitted. As an additional control for antibody specificity, recombinant neurotrophin 100 Î¼g ml was preincubated with the pri-mary antibody for 4 hours at 37Â°C before incubation on spinal cord sections to specifically compete for antibody binding. Exposure to the neurotrophin to which the anti-body was directed eliminated staining of spinal moto-neurons, whereas preincubation with other recombinant neurotrophins had no effect on motoneuron immuno-histochemical staining. Specificity of our immunohisto-chemical results is further supported by our ISH studies demonstrating neurotrophin mRNA in the same cell types in which we demonstrate expression of the neurotrophin protein. DISCUSSION Spinal motoneurons and neurotrophins Previous work strongly suggests that neuromuscular synapses are modified by neurotrophins derived from muscle Lohof et al., 1993 Funakoshi et al., 1995 Stoop and Poo, 1996 Wang and Poo, 1997 Wang et al., 1998 Wells et al., 1999 . This suggestion is supported by the requisite expression by muscle of mRNA for neurotrophins NT-3, NT-4, and BDNF Maisonpierre et al., 1990 Hender-son et al., 1993 Funakoshi et al., 1995 Griesbeck et al., 1995 and by the presence of Trk receptors on motoneurons Koliatsos et al., 1991, 1993 Henderson et al., 1993 Yan et al., 1997a . Although some early reports indicated that neuro-trophin genes were not expressed in the adult spinal cord e.g., Maisonpierre et al., 1990 Ernfors et al., 1990 , more sensitive RNase protection analyses have reported expres-sion of NT-3, NT-4, and BDNF mRNAs in adult rat spinal cord Funakoshi et al., 1993, 1995 Griesbeck et al., 1995 Yamamoto et al., 1996 . NT-3 and BDNF protein have now been localized to adult spinal motoneurons Zhou and Rush, 1994 Junier et al., 1998 Nishio et al., 1998 Dreyfus et al., 1999 , but it was unclear whether these neurotroph-ins are synthesized by motoneurons or transported from other sources. By using in situ hybridization and immuno-histochemistry, we have verified expression of NT-3 and BDNF by motoneurons, and discovered expression of NT-4 by adult and developing rat motoneurons. These findings support speculation that motoneurons themselves may be a source of the neurotrophins involved in modulating the intrinsic properties of motoneurons Gonzalez and Collins, 1997 Mendell et al., 1999 Seebach et al., 1999 as well as the central and peripheral synaptic function of motoneu-rons. In developing animals, our studies demonstrate that NT-3, NT-4, and BDNF mRNAs were all detectable in motoneurons by the second postnatal week, but the time of first appearance of each neurotrophin differs. NT-3 mRNA was readily detected in motoneurons at P1 data not shown , consistent with a previous study that also re-ported NT-3 mRNA in spinal motoneurons of embryonic rats Schecterson and Bothwell, 1992 . BDNF mRNA expression in motoneurons was first detected at P5 and NT-4 mRNA was first detected in these cells at P9. This expression of NT-4 and BDNF begins at the time when motoneurons are first able to survive axotomy reviewed by Snider et al., 1992 . It may be that motoneuron survival independent of target-derived signals is related to the capacity of these cells to express one or more of the neurotrophin proteins. Patterns of BDNF and NT-4 expression Coexpression of the neurotrophins BDNF and NT-4 in many adult motoneurons is consistent with the emerging realization that multiple neurotrophins are likely to be required for trophic support of any neuronal population reviewed in Knipper and Rylett, 1997 see also Barrett et al., 1998 . For example, NT-3, NT-4, and BDNF provide complementary and cooperative functions to support the survival of all nodose ganglion neurons ElShamy and Ernfors, 1997 . Although gene ablation studies suggest that these neurotrophins are not required for motoneuron survival reviewed by Snider, 1994 , all three neurotroph-ins may together provide a combination of trophic support of motoneuron function during development and in adult animals. Although many ventral lumbar spinal motoneurons express both NT-4 and BDNF mRNAs, some express one but not the other or neither neurotrophin mRNA. Differen-tial gene expression among spinal cord motoneurons has been demonstrated very early in the spinal cord where developing motoneurons express different combinations of Lim transcription factor genes that ultimately direct these cells to different motoneuron pools Tsuchida et al., 1994 . It is possible, although not specifically addressed in this study, that neurotrophin expression is restricted to specific motor nuclei.Apart from the muscles they supply, motoneu-rons also exhibit wide physiological diversity Binder et al., 1996 , and it is tempting to speculate that this diver-sity relates to differential expression of neurotrophins. The localization of both mRNA and protein for NT-3, NT-4, and BDNF to adult rat spinal motoneurons strongly suggests that like some other neuronal populations, these cells synthesize neurotrophin that may be available for local use through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms Acheson and Lindsay, 1996 . It should be noted that colocalization of neurotrophin mRNA and protein within motoneurons does not preclude the retrograde transport of neurotrophins from muscle targets, and our results cannot distinguish local from target-derived neurotrophin. How-ever, in the case of NT-4, muscle-based protein is appar-ently not retrogradely transported in the intact system Curtis et al., 1995 . It is also possible that motoneurons synthesize neurotrophins for afferent neurons that syn-apse on motoneuron targets. The expression of multiple neurotrophins in the DRG, however, suggests that moto-neuron-derived neurotrophins may not be required by sensory neurons Yamamoto et al., 1996 . Potential relevance to motoneuron synaptic function Application of the neurotrophins NT-3, NT-4, and or BDNF alters the function of motoneuron synapses. Trans-mission at developing neuromuscular synapses in nerve-muscle cultures from Xenopus is potentiated by NT-3, NT-4, and or BDNF Lohof et al., 1993 Stoop and Poo, 1996 Wang and Poo, 1997 Wang et al., 1998 . Synaptic potentials evoked by primary afferent fibers in rat motoneu- rons at P8 are altered by administration over the first week of life of either the neurotrophins BDNF or NT-4 or a chimeric TrkB-IgG recombinant fusion protein to reduce endogenous neurotrophin Seebach et al., 1999 . In adult cats, application of NT-3 to the central cut end of a motor nerve reverses the progressive fall in amplitude otherwise observed for excitatory potentials produced at Ia-MN synapses Munson et al., 1997 Mendell et al., 1999 . For neurotrophins to have meaningful roles in producing these synaptic effects in vivo, they ââmust be expressed in the right places and at the right timesââ McAllister et al., 1999 . Data presented here show that the TrkB ligands NT-4 and BDNF are expressed by motoneurons. Thus, motoneurons represent an additional source of neuro-trophin that must be considered together with neuro-trophin derived from muscle in evaluating neurotrophin function. Moreover, the time of onset in expression of BDNF at P5 and of NT-4 at P9 might relate to the maturation of the rat neuromuscular synapse. It may be significant, for example, that the onset of motoneuron NT-4 mRNA expression and the elimination of polyneuro-nal innervation coincide cf. Brown et al., 1976 . At the Ia-MN synapse, our demonstration of neurotrophin expres-sion makes it possible that the motoneuron acts as a target-derived source of neurotrophin, and expression occurs at a time when these synapses are undergoing change Seebach and Mendell, 1996 . Here again, however, a potential role for presynaptic neurotrophin is possible, given that all three neurotrophins are expressed by dorsal root ganglia Yamamoto et al., 1996 and that anterograde neurotrophin transport has been demonstrated von Bar-theld et al., 1996 . Our present report describing the localization of synthe-sis and production of the neurotrophins NT-4, BDNF, and NT-3 to adult spinal motoneurons and the different devel-opmental appearance of each of these molecules suggests that neuronally derived neurotrophins could be involved in regulating both the establishment and modification of intrinsic motoneuron properties, synaptic function, or both. RESULTS Neurotrophin mRNA expression in the lumbosacral spinal cord of adult rats The cellular hybridization with mRNA for neurotroph-ins NT-4, BDNF, and NT-3 was widespread in the spinal gray matter of adult rats. Staining for all three neuro-trophin mRNAs was evident in portions of the dorsal horn and the intermediate zone and was conspicuous in large cell bodies in the ventral horn. These findings provide the first demonstration of cellular localization of NT-4 mRNA in the central nervous system Fig. 1A . If NT-4 expression is regulated by synaptic activity Funakoshi et al., 1995 Ibanez, 1996 , the widespread expression of NT-4 mRNA may be of particular significance for ongoing modification of synaptic function in the adult spinal cord. Although early studies concluded that BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs were not expressed in spinal cord motoneurons e.g., Ernfors et al., 1990 both mRNA and protein for these neurotrophins has subsequently been reported to be present in adult rat spinal cord, consistent with our findings Funakoshi et al., 1993, 1995 Yamamoto et al., 1996 Li et al., 1997 Yan et al., 1997b Junier et al., 1998 Nishio et al., 1998 . Some spinal astrocytes of both white and grey matter, identified by immunohistochemical staining of adjacent sections for glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP , also express these neurotrophin mRNAs data not shown , as recently re-ported Dreyfus et al., 1999 . Less attention is given to NT-3 mRNA expression in this report because this mRNA is expressed by fewer cells in the adult spinal cord and we were specifically interested in examining the TrkB ligands in our initial analysis. A more complete profile of NT-3 mRNA expression in the spinal cord will be reported elsewhere. NT-4 and BDNF mRNA expression by motoneurons in adult rats The prominence of neurotrophin mRNA-positive cells in the ventral horn of the spinal cord prompted us to count and measure large multipolar ventral horn cells bilater-ally in the L4 and L5 segments of two adult rats to estimate the number of a-motoneurons expressing NT-4 and BDNF mRNAs. Greater than 80% of the large neuro-trophin-positive ventral horn cells examined have a soma diameter of at least 35 Î¼ and, thereby, were classified as a-motoneurons see Materials and Methods section . These cells were consistently identified both in dorsolateral and ventrolateral motor columns. We estimate that hundreds of L4 and L5 a-motoneurons express NT-4 mRNA 449 and 352 in two rats . Similarly, hundreds of a-motoneurons express BDNF mRNA in the two animals 492 and 426 . More direct demonstration that a-motoneurons express these neurotrophins was obtained by verifying motoneu-ron identity from retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold. Figure 2 shows Fluoro-Gold labeled a-motoneurons with diameters greater than 35 Î¼, that express either NT-4 or BDNF mRNA. The proportion of sampled a-motoneurons that express NT-4 and BDNF is given in Figure 3. An estimate of the number of a-motoneurons in a series of consecutive sec-tions of spinal segments L4 and L5 was determined by staining every fourth 10 Î¼ section with cresyl violet to identify cells. This number was compared with the number of motoneurons expressing either NT-4 or BDNF mRNAon alternate sections. Figure 3 shows that these neurotrophin mRNAs were not expressed by all sampled a-motoneurons, but that for both NT-4 and BDNF mRNAs, expression was observed in well over half of the a-motoneurons sampled. Coincident and divergent patterns of NT-4 and BDNF mRNA in adult rat spinal cord The extensive expression of NT-4 and BDNF mRNAs suggested that many motoneurons coexpress these neuro-trophins. To demonstrate neurotrophin coexpression, we examined consecutive sections for NT-4 and BDNF mRNA in individual motoneurons in situ. We find that many, perhaps most, motoneurons express both BDNF and NT-4 mRNAs Fig. 4AâC . However, we also identified motoneu-rons scattered throughout the adult rat ventral spinal cord gray matter that express either NT-4 or BDNF but not both. To illustrate this nonoverlapping pattern of neuro-trophin mRNA expression, a group of motoneurons that express NT-4 mRNA but do not express BDNF mRNA is shown in Figure 4DâF. Similarly, motoneurons positive for BDNF mRNA that do not express NT-4 mRNA are appar- ent on adjacent lumbar spinal cord sections as are motoneu-rons expressing neither neurotrophin mRNA data not shown . These results indicate that adult ventral lumbar spinal motoneurons differentially express neurotrophin mRNAs. The overlapping but nonidentical patterns of neurotrophin in situ hybridization also support the conten-tion that specific hybridization is detected with this proto-col. Neurotrophin protein expression in adult spinal motoneurons Because of the sensitivity and reliability of our in situ hybridization protocol, we have focused our initial studies on the expression of neurotrophin mRNA in the adult rat lumbosacral spinal cord. However, we have also assessed the expression of neurotrophin protein in adult spinal motoneurons to confirm that the mRNA we detect is translated into potentially biologically relevant neuro-trophic factor. The presence of neurotrophin protein was examined by using a newly available monoclonal antibody to NT-4, and polyclonal antisera to BDNF and NT-3 Chemicon . The results demonstrate immunohistochemi-cal localization of NT-4, BDNF, and NT-3 in motoneurons of the ventral lumbar spinal cord Fig. 5AâC . Preliminary analysis of adjacent sections from two animals indicates good correspondence of protein and mRNA expression in adult rat spinal motoneurons for NT-4 and BDNF. This finding indicates that motoneurons themselves produce NT-4 and BDNF that may be used locally in an autocrine or paracrine manner. By contrast, the presence of NT-3 protein in substantially more motoneurons than express NT-3 mRNA Fig. 1C suggests that this neurotrophin is derived by adult motoneurons from other sources, as suggested by Zhao and Rush 1994 . Neurotrophin mRNA expression in the developing spinal cord Because neurotrophins are important to development in other areas of the central nervous system e.g., Davies, 1997 Lindholm et al., 1997 and because synapses with motoneurons respond to neurotrophins in neonatal ani-mals Seebach et al., 1999 , neurotrophin expression was examined in the ventral horn of rats during the first several days after birth. At postnatal day 1 P1 , expres-sion of mRNAencoding BDNF or NT-4 was undetectable in the ventral horn of the spinal cord Fig. 6A,B , but both messages are detected in the dorsal horn. By P5, BDNF but not NT-4 mRNA was readily detected in the ventral horn, apparently in motoneuron cell bodies Fig. 6C,D . Thus, BDNF mRNA expression appears to be initiated before NT-4 mRNA expression in the postnatal rat ventral spinal cord, although both neurotrophin messages are coexpressed in many individual motoneurons in adults see Fig. 3 . Strong expression of NT-4 mRNA in motoneu-rons was apparent by P9 Fig. 6E , and BDNF expression is maintained at this age. The continued expression of neuro- trophin mRNA in individual cells was not exhaustively studied here, but the expression patterns at P14 and P23 data not shown suggest that once the expression of each message is initiated, it is retained into adulthood.

J. Comp. Neurol. 416 131â142, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. During development of connections between the thala-mus and the cortex in the monkey Rakic, 1977 and the cat Shatz and Luskin, 1986 Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 , afferents from the thalamus are reported to undergo an extended waiting period in a largely transient layer, the subplate, before eventually growing into the developing layers that will form the mature visual cortex. Interactions between thalamic axons and subplate cells may underlie selection of cortical targets Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 , and the cells of the subplate are said to play a pioneering role in the pathway from the cortex to the thalamus McConnell et al., 1989 . In contrast, during development of the same connections in the marsupial wallaby, the tammar Macro-pus eugenii Sheng et al., 1991 Marotte et al., 1997 , we found that thalamocortical afferents were distributed throughout most of the depth of the cortex up to the compact cell zone of the superficial cortical plate from the time of initial axon ingrowth, and they invaded the layers developing beneath this zone as they appeared. Similar findings have been reported in rodents Erzurumlu and Jhaveri, 1990, 1992 Catalano et al., 1991 Miller et al., 1993 Kageyama and Robertson, 1993 and in another marsupial, Monodelphis domestica Molna Â´r et al., 1998b . Furthermore, in the wallaby, the first cells to project to the thalamus from visual cortex appeared to be those residing in layers 5 and 6 Sheng et al., 1991 . We deduced that it was cells of layers 5 and 6 and not subplate cells that were the first to project to the thalamus in the wallaby, because there were two bands of cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus LGN and the lateral posterior nucleus from the onset of corticothalamic projections, and, by postnatal day 76 P76 , these two bands of cells resided in cytoarchitecturally identifiable layers 5 and 6. Nevertheless, their identity prior to P76 needs to be confirmed They may not comprise the same two populations. The subplate, as originally defined by Kostovic and Mollivar 1974 and situated at the top of the intermediate zone, could be identified in the developing wallaby cortex, and thalamocortical axons did not wait in this region Sheng et al., 1991 . However, Luskin and Shatz 1985a , on the basis of birthdating studies in the cat, and Kostovic and Rakic 1990 in the monkey have redefined the superficial boundary of the subplate to include part of what originally was regarded as the cortical plate. At P40, we were able to define tentatively the extent of the cortical plate by the presence of cells projecting to the thalamus, but it is conceivable that, prior to this time, the subplate may include part or all of the region beneath the compact cell zone of the cortical plate. To answer these questions, we have determined the birthdates of the neurons that form the mature layers of the wallaby visual cortex with the aid of tritiated thymi-dine autoradiography. The position of cells identified by their birthdates was then followed at various early stages during development. This enabled us to identify unequivo-cally the extent of the cortical plate during early develop-ment and, thus, to determine whether there is a waiting period for afferents in the wallaby prior to their invasion of the cortical plate. We also identified cells sending a projection to the thalamus prior to the time when the layers they were situated in were cytoarchitectecturally recognizable. Finally, the timing of the genesis of layers 6 and 4, cortical targets of thalamocortical afferents Sheng et al., 1991 Vidyasagar et al., 1992 , and the timing of their migration to the cortical plate in relation to the ingrowth and distribution of these afferents in the cortex were determined. This was to test the suggestion that a waiting period in species with a protracted developmental time course may be related to a discrepancy in the time of arrival of afferents from the thalamus in the cortex and the generation and migration to the cortical plate of their target cells Erzurumlu and Jhaveri, 1992 Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 . Some of these results have been published in abstract form Marotte and Sheng, 1995 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-one wallabies Macropus eugenii from a breeding colony were used in the study. All experiments were approved by the Australian National University Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. Animals age # 36 days were of known birthdate, whereas the age of older animals was determined from a chart of head lengths of animals of known age produced from data obtained in our laboratory. A straight-line regression of age on head length of animals of known age n 5 122 animals provided a table of animals of predicted age as a function of head length, with a standard error of 2 days. The table is on our web page http biology.anu.edu.au research-groups DN . Injections Twenty-one animals ages P0, P5, P8, P10, P12, P13, P16, P24, P28, P32, P36, P40, P43, P46, P50, P54, P60, P66, P73, P80, and P87 were injected with methyl-3H thymi-dine specific activity, 47â90 Curies mmol Amersham, Little Chalfont, Herts, United Kingdom and were exam-ined after the cortex was mature, at 250 days of age. Another 20 animals were injected at P12, P16, P28, or P36 and examined at shorter time intervals. Animals injected at P12 were examined at P16, P19, P22, P35, P45, and P54. Animals injected at P16 were examined at P23, P24, P28, P35, P45, P54, and P65. Animals injected at P28 were examined at P34, P45, P54, and P65. Animals injected at P36 were examined at P45, P54, and P65. Animals re-ceived 10 Î¼g g body weight intraperitoneally in a volume of 6â55 Î¼l, depending on their age. In some cases, the amount was concentrated by drying it down and redissolving it in a smaller volume of sterile, distilled water prior to injection. Autoradiography Animals were deeply anesthetized by hypothermia youn-ger than P35 or xylazine 0.6 mg g body weight and perfused briefly with 0.9% sodium chloride followed by 10% formol saline. Tissues were fixed for at least 1 week. In animals older than P28, brains were cryoprotected, and frozen sections were cut coronally at 40 Î¼m. The brains of younger animals were embedded in wax, and coronal sections were cut at 10 Î¼m or 12 Î¼m.After defatting frozen sections or dewaxing wax sections and drying, sections were dipped in Ilford K2 emulsion Ilford, United King-dom diluted 1 1 with distilled water. They were exposed for 10 weeks at 4Â°C and then developed in Phenisol Ilford . Sections were stained lightly with thionin. Se-lected sections adjacent to those processed for autoradiog-raphy were stained with thionin. Analysis of cell birthdates For each animal that was analyzed at P250 cortical maturity , plots or counts of heavily labeled neurons were made in two sections of area 17 of the visual cortex at the same rostrocaudal and mediolateral level. This was 1.5 mm from the caudal pole of the cortex in the sectioned material and stretched from just lateral to the dorsal pole of the visual cortex to 5 mm lateral to this position Fig. 2a . The positions of heavily labeled cells in animals injected at ages P16, P28, P32, P36, P40, P60, and P73 were plotted with the aid of the Neurotrace program InterActions Company, Cambridge, MA . Camera lucida drawings were made of the area at a magnification of 325, and the borders of the cortical layers were drawn. The positions of heavily labeled cells were marked by using a magnification of 3400. Heavily labeled cells were defined as those with silver grains over their nuclei equal to or greater than half the number of grains over the nucleus of the most heavily labeled cell in that case. In the remaining cases, heavily labeled cells were counted at a magnifica-tion of 3400 and assigned to layers by using a magnifica-tion of 340â100. Because of the very low density of neurons in layer 1, a larger sample area had to be examined for the presence of heavily labeled neurons in this layer. A minimum of four sections from the same level of cortex used for the above analysis were examined for each animal. Analysis of cell position during development In animals examined at shorter intervals after an injec-tion of thymidine, plots of heavily labeled cells were made in coronal sections through the caudal visual cortex. Camera lucida drawings were made at a magnification of 325, marking the position of the sample areas. Labelled cells were examined at a magnification of 3400. The positions of heavily labeled cells were plotted on camera lucida drawings of each area that were drawn at a magnification of 3250 or 3100, depending on age, with the boundaries of the developing cortical layers marked. Com-posite drawings were prepared in which the positions of heavily labeled cells from animals injected at different ages and examined at the same age were shown on the same camera lucida drawing. DISCUSSION This article describes the birthdates of cells of the visual cortex of the wallaby using tritiated thymidine autoradiog-raphy. The genesis of the cells that comprise the mature layers is entirely postnatal, and cortical development shows the ââinside-outââ mode of development common to other mammalian species, both eutherian and marsupial. The tagging of cells by their birthdate enabled the extent of the cortical plate to be defined during the early stages of thalamocortical ingrowth and identified the loosely packed zone of cells beneath the thin compact zone at the superfi-cial margin of the cortical plate as also being part of the cortical plate. Comparison of these results with previously published work on the distribution of thalamic afferents and corticothalamic-projecting cells Sheng et al., 1991 shows that afferents do not wait in the subplate while the differentiation of cortical layers unfolds, but they invade which layer 4 cells, a major target of afferents from the the developing cortical layers as soon as the cells that comprise these layers begin accumulating in the loosely packed zone at the base of the cortical plate, beginning with layer 6. At this time, the cells of layer 4 had yet to commence their generation. The first cortical cells that projected to the thalamus were identified as the cells of layer 5, which, at the time that their axons reached the thalamus, still resided at the top of the cortical plate in the compact cell zone, and the cells of layer 6, which, at this time, were located at the base of the cortical plate in the loosely packed zone of cells. Cortical neurogenesis Cortical development in the wallaby shows the typical pattern of development described for other species of eutherian mammals Agevine and Sidman, 1961 Shimada and Langman, 1970 Lund and Mustari, 1977 Rakic, 1977 Luskin and Shatz, 1985b Jackson et al., 1989 and marsu-pial mammals Reynolds et al., 1985 Sanderson and Aitken, 1990 Harman et al., 1995 , in which deeper layers of the cortex are born prior to those in more superficial layers. The exception is layer 1, in which cells are born in low numbers over the entire period of cortical neurogen-esis. This also has been reported for two marsupial species Sanderson andAitken, 1990 Harman et al., 1995 , and, in the rat, the cells of layer 1 also have an extended period of neurogenesis Bayer and Altman, 1990 . In the cat visual cortex, they are among the earliest cells born Luskin and Shatz, 1985a,b , but their generation also continues to later stages of development Luskin and Shatz, 1985b . In the tammar, the generation of the cells that comprise the mature layers of the visual cortex is entirely postnatal, as it is in the possum Sanderson and Aitken, 1990 and the quokka Harman et al., 1995 whereas, in eutherian mammals, such as the rat Lund and Mustari, 1977 , cat Luskin and Shatz, 1985b , and monkey Rakic, 1977 , cell genesis is prenatal. In the ferret, which is an example of a eutherian mammal that is born relatively early in develop-ment although not as early as marsupials , visual cortical neurogenesis extends into the postnatal period Jackson et al., 1989 . In the wallaby, the time period of neurogenesis is protracted, extending over approximately 2 months, much longer than in the cat Luskin and Shatz, 1985b and similar to that in the monkey Rakic, 1977 . Similar to these two species, there was an extended period of genesis for each layer in the wallaby, ranging from 1 week for layer 2 to 2â3 weeks for layers 3â6. In the rat, with its rapid period of development, the layers are generated in 2 days Lund and Mustari, 1977 . Extent of the cortical plate in developing cortex In our previous study Sheng et al., 1991 , we could not delineate unequivocally the boundaries of the cortical plate at early stages of development, whereas Reynolds et al. 1985 , on cytoarchitectonic grounds, considered that the loosely packed zone beneath the superficial compact cell zone of the cortical plate was part of the subplate, and not the cortical plate, up to P75. In the current study, the entire extent of the loosely packed zone of cells was identified as part of the cortical plate, because it contained cells that later form the cellular layers of the mature cortex Boulder Committee, 1970 from its first appear-ance. At its inception, the loosely packed zone contained a mixture of early-born layer 6 cells and cells found in the white matter at maturity. The latter, we believe, can be described properly as displaced layer 6 cells and are not a separate population. This is because, early in develop-ment, cells born on P12 and P16 all resided in the loosely packed zone rather than in the layer at the top of the intermediate zone, which was designated as the subplate in our previous study. It was only later in development that a few of the cells born on P12 and P16 were found displaced into the subplate. In another species of wallaby, the quokka, Harman et al. 1995 also identified this loosely packed zone of cells as part of the cortical plate on the basis of cell birthdating Harman et al., 1995 . Jones et al. 1991 described a transient expression of fetuin-like glycoprotein by cells beneath the compact zone of the cortical plate early in development in the tammar. Whether this represents a disappearance of these cells, suggesting that the ââtrueââ subplate may disappear early Molna Â´r et al., 1998b , or the down-regulation of glycopro-tein is not known. The relation of these cells to developing layers in the current study could not be determined, because the cytoarchitecture of the cortex in the study by Jones et al. was not shown. The layer we designate as the subplate also is present in the quokka designated as the upper intermediate zone Harman et al., 1995 , and the subdivisions of the intermediate zone are apparent throughout development in both species and comprise the white matter at maturity. The subplate appears to corre-spond to the lower subplate in the cat cortex Luskin and Shatz, 1985a and the monkey cortex Kostovic and Rakic, 1990 . No upper subplate was identified in the tammar the loosely packed zone above the subplate was identified as the cortical plate. It is worth noting that, in monkeys and humans, Kostovic and Rakic 1990 identified an upper subplate below the densely packed cortical plate that increased in thickness during development and had architectonic features similar to those seen in the loosely packed zone of the wallaby cortex. It would be of interest to identify unequivocally the cells that comprise this layer throughout development in the monkey by birthdating. In rodents, the subplate is not transient and forms a layer at the base of layer 6 that is called layer 6b in some studies Catalano et al., 1991 Valverde et al., 1995 . Thus, strictly speaking, the subplate may be considered as part of the cortical plate. Detailed birthdating studies Bayer and Altman, 1990 have shown that subplate cells are among the earliest cells generated however, rather than settling immediately in the intermediate zone with later born cells forming the cortical plate, they reside in the cortical plate before settling beneath it. This would make these cells analogous to the early-born cells of layer 6 and cells that are found in the white matter at maturity in the tammar see also Harman et al., 1995 . By further analogy, the intermediate zone, including the subplate in the tammar, consists of migrating cells en route to the cortical plate. Is there a waiting period for thalamic afferents? In the cat, afferents wait and continue to accumulate in the subplate for 2 weeks Shatz and Luskin, 1986 Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 while the cortical layers develop at the base of the cortical plate, before growing into these develop-ing layers. In the tammar, the identification of the entire loosely packed zone beneath the compact zone as a part of the cortical plate from its inception means that there is no waiting period for thalamocortical afferents of the kind described in the cat. Although there is a short period of a few days when afferents are in the intermediate zone beneath the compact zone of the cortical plate, they begin to grow into the layers that will form the mature cortex as soon as these cells leave the compact cell zone and settle below it to form the loosely packed zone. This mode of development is typical not only of marsupials see also Marotte et al., 1997 Molna Â´r et al., 1998b , but it also has been described in eutherian mammals. In rodents, tha-lamic afferents grow into layer 6, then into layer 5, and so on, as each of these layers differentiates from the base of the cortical plate Erzurumlu and Jhaveri, 1990 Cat-alano et al., 1991 Erzurumlu and Jhaveri, 1992 Kageyama and Robertson, 1993 Miller et al., 1993 Molna Â´r et al., 1998a . Is the developmental time table related to the existence of a waiting period? It has been suggested that the apparent absence of a waiting period in the subplate in rodent species is because of their rapid developmental time course compared with that of the cat and monkey Catalano et al., 1991 . For example, thalamic afferents in the rat grow into layer 4 of the visual cortex on P1âP2, 24â25 days after conception Kageyama and Robertson, 1993 . In the cat, this period is increased to 55â60 days Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 , whereas, in the tammar, it is .90 days. In the cat, afferents wait in the subplate for 2 weeks. If the waiting period was related to the time course of development, then one would expect a waiting period in the subplate in the wallaby of 4 weeks. This was not seen. A waiting period may be related to the time of arrival of afferents from the thalamus in the cortex in relation to the generation of their primary target, the layer 4 cells Erzu-rumlu and Jhaveri, 1992 Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 . In the rat, it has been proposed that afferents do not wait in the subplate, because layer 4 cells are almost in position when afferents are invading the deeper cortical layers Erzu-rumlu and Jhaveri, 1992 . In the cat, afferents arrive in the visual cortex Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 just before the genesis of the cells of layer 4 begins Luskin and Shatz, 1985b and well before these cells reach the cortical plate by around embryonic day 55 E55 Shatz and Luskin, 1986 , but they do not begin to invade the deeper layers of the cortex until E50 Ghosh and Shatz, 1992 . In the tammar, however, compared with the cat, there is an even greater discrepancy between the time of arrival of tha-lamic afferents in the visual cortex and the onset of genesis of layer 4 cells and their arrival in the cortical plate. Afferents reach the visual cortex by P15 Sheng at al, 1991 , but the current study showed that the genesis of layer 4 cells does not commence until .2 weeks later, at P32. Nevertheless, afferents are found in the deeper layers of the cortical plate long before this and as soon as these layers begin differentiating at the base of the compact zone of the cortical plate. They do not undergo an extended wait in the subplate. Indeed, it is difficult to understand why they should. Layer 6, which is generated and begins differentiating earlier, also is a target for these afferents not only in the tammar Sheng et al., 1991 Vidyasagar et al., 1992 but also in the cat LeVay and Gilbert, 1976 and the rat Peters and Feldman, 1976 . First cortical cells to project to the thalamus The initial cortical projection to the thalamus comes from the cells of layers 5 and 6. There was no evidence of an early projection from cells that could be identified as subplate cells. Similarly, in the wallaby somatosensory cortex Marotte et al., 1997 and in the ferret Clascaet Â´ al., 1995 , subplate cells are not the first to project to the thalamus, whereas, in the cat McConnell et al., 1989 and in rodents DeCarlos and OâLeary, 1992 Miller et al., 1993 , they are said to form or contribute to the initial projection. Although there may be species differences in the identity of early-projecting cells, Clascaet Â´ al. 1995 suggested that methodological differences may underlie these differing results. They found that, when tracers other than carbocyanine dyes were used to label the projection, there was no projection from subplate cells, indicating that transcellular labeling was a problem when using these dyes. This technique was used to label the projection in the cat McConnell et al., 1989 and in rodents DeCarlos and OâLeary, 1992 Miller et al., 1993 . CONCLUSIONS Figure 11 summarizes the major events in the develop-ment of the visual cortex in the tammar.Afferents from the thalamus reach the putative visual cortex by P15 and grow into the loosely packed zone at the base of the cortical plate, which contains the early developing layers of the cortex, as soon as the zone begins to form at P22. There is no waiting period for afferents below this zone as it develops.At this time, layer 6 cells are still being born, and the genesis of layer 4 cells has not begun. It is more than 2 weeks later that cortical efferents first reach the thalamus, and these efferents are from cells in layers 5 and 6. Layers 5 and 6 cannot be recognized cytoarchitectonically until P76 and P65, respectively. During all this time, afferents still are distributed evenly throughout the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate. They begin to concentrate in layer 4 only by P99 and attain an adult-like distribution by P118. Eye opening does not occur until around P140. Despite the long interval between the time of ingrowth of afferents from the thalamus and the birth of cells of layer 4, there is no waiting period in the subplate. It is clear that such a waiting period in marsupials and in rodents is not necessary for either the process of thalamocortical innerva-tion or the formation of a typical mammalian cortex. RESULTS Birthdates of cells of visual cortical layers Figure 1 shows labeled cells within area 17 of the mature cortex resulting from an injection of tritiated thymidine at P60. This sample is from layer 3. Both heavily labeled and lightly labeled cells are present the more heavily labeled cells stop dividing and begin to differentiate close to the time of injection, whereas the more lightly labeled cells continue to divide, thus diluting the label. Area 17 in the wallaby is well defined cytoarchi-tectonically, and its main feature is a cell-sparse layer at the bottom of layer 3 that disappears abruptly at the border of area 18 Mayner, 1989 Vidyasagar et al., 1992 Fig. 2a . Lamination in the cortex is prominent Fig. 2a,b , and heavily labeled cells can be assigned clearly to layers. For example, after an injection at P46, the most heavily labeled cells were found in layer 4 Fig. 2b,c . Cells that formed the layers of the mature visual cortex were born in a deep-to-superficial sequence, apart from those in layer 1 see below , as illustrated in the histo-grams of Figure 3. Cells were born over an extended period of time, reflecting the protracted development that is characteristic of this species of wallaby, and entirely within the postnatal period. Prior to P12, no heavily labeled cells were detected in the cortex. Neurogenesis of the layers of the mature cortex extended from P12 to P73. On P12, low numbers of cells were generated in the white matter and in layer 6. Small numbers of cells also were generated in the white matter at P16 but not at later ages. Generation of cells in layer 6 occurred from P12 to P28, at which time it reached a peak. Layer 5 cells were born over a longer time period, from P16 to P40, with maximum numbers produced at P32. Generation of layers 4 and 3 also extended over a longer period. Layer 4 was generated from P32 to P50, with peak numbers being produced between P40 and P50. Generation of layer 3 occurred from P50 to P73, peaking at P60. Layer 2 cells had a relatively short period of generation from P66 to P73, whereas cells in layer 1 were born in extremely low numbers over the whole period from P16 to P73. Position of identified cells during development To identify unequivocally the cells that comprised the layers of the cortex during the early stages of development, a series of animals received injections at the time of the birth of cells of known cortical layers, and the positions of these cells were examined at varying times subsequently. Injections were timed to span the period of cell genesis for layers 5 and 6 and to detect early-born layer 4 cells. Animals were injected on P12 and P16 to label early-born layer 6 cells and small numbers of the earliest born layer 5 cells , on P28 to label later-born layer 6 cells and early-born layer 5 cells, and on P36 to label late-born layer 5 cells and early-born layer 4 cells. An example from such an animal, which received an injection on P28, is shown in Figure 4. This animal survived to P54, and, by that time, heavily labeled cells that were born on P28 resided in a well-defined band in the loosely packed zone of cells below the compact cell zone at the top of the cortical plate. Position of identified cells at early stages of in-growth of thalamic afferents. In describing the develop- ing cortical layers, the nomenclature of Sheng et al. 1991 has been used. This was based on the terminology of the Boulder Committee 1970 as modified by Kostovic and Mollivar 1974 . At the earliest stages of development, the putative visual cortex at the dorsal and caudal pole of the cortex was identified on the basis of the position of tracer injections, which resulted in label in the LGN. These connections were detected first on P15 Sheng et al., 1990 . In this region of cortex, the cortical plate, which contains cells that are destined to form the mature layers of the cortex, appeared first on P12. Prior to P22, it consisted of a densely packed, narrow band of cells between the marginal zone and the intermediate zone, with the subventricular and ventricular zones at the base of the cortex Figs. 5a, 6 . The marginal zone will form layer 1, and the intermediate zone will form the white matter of the mature cortex. Beginning at P22, a new layer containing cells at lower density, the loosely packed zone, appeared beneath the compact cell zone of the cortical plate Fig. 5b . Up to and including this stage, the intermediate zone remained a homogeneous layer, and this also was the case at P24. It was not until P28 that the subplate, as originally defined by Kostovic and Mollivar 1974 , could be recognized clearly as a zone of cells at lower density at the top of the intermediate zone Fig. 5c . By this age, the loosely packed zone had increased in thickness, and the cells were ar-ranged in parallel arrays typical of this layer from this stage onward Fig. 5c . From the time of their ingrowth, thalamocortical axons are distributed up to the base of the compact cell zone of the cortical plate Sheng et al., 1991 . Therefore, it was of interest to chart the positions of cells destined to form layer 6 over this period, because it is the first of the cellular layers to be born and one of the main targets of ingrowing thalamocortical axons Sheng et al., 1991 Vidyasagar et al., 1992 . P12 was the earliest age at which the birth of cells destined for layer 6 of visual cortex could be detected, and, by P16, some of these cells still were found in the ventricular zone, whereas others had migrated out of this zone into the subventricular zone Fig. 6 . There are some cells born prior to this time, as evidenced by the presence of a cortical plate from P12. These cells may not have been detected at maturity in the visual cortex because of the enormous growth of the cortex over this period the rostrocaudal extent of the cortex increases by 1600% from P12 to adulthood , causing dilution of labeled cells, or they may have died. The cells born on P12 also contribute to the early compact zone of the cortical plate, reaching there on P19, prior to the formation of the loosely packed zone. By P22, they had settled beneath the compact cell zone in the loosely packed zone Fig. 6 . That is, early-born layer 6 cells form the loosely packed zone as they are displaced inward by the arrival of later born layer 6 cells and the earliest born layer 5 cells born on P16 in the compact cell zone at the top of the cortical plate. By P24, these latter cells, in turn, had entered the loosely packed zone immediately adjacent to the compact cell zone and, by P28, were deeper in the increasingly thick loosely packed zone. Because the loosely packed zone contains cells destined to form layer 6 from its first appearance, by definition, it forms part of the cortical plate. early-born layer 6 cells, which are generated on P12 and P16, and late-born layer 6 and early-born layer 5 cells, which are generated on P28, that were labeled by tritiated thymidine are shown in Figure 7a, and the structure of the cortex is shown in Figure 7b. The loosely packed zone of the cortical plate was increased further in thickness compared with that seen at P28. The earliest born cells of layer 6 born on P12 were located at the base of this zone, with cells born on P16 immediately above them, in a position in relation to the base of the loosely packed zone similar to that seen at P28. Between the latter cells and the base of the cortical plate, there were unlabeled cells that had left the compact cell zone of the cortical plate and settled in the loosely packed zone since P28. They were comprised of cells born after P16 and prior to P28, the vast majority of which belonged to layer 6. The last-born layer 6 cells and the early-born layer 5 cells still were migrating toward the cortical plate and had reached the top of the intermediate zone and the base of the subplate by this stage. At this stage, thalamic afferents are distributed evenly and densely up to the base of the compact cell zone of the cortical plate Sheng et al., 1991 , i.e., they are distributed throughout a large proportion of the depth of the cortical plate among the cells of layer 6. Note that the cells that will form layer 4, which is the other main target of afferents from the thalamus, have only just begun to be born at this stage. cells by their birthdate is illustrated in Figure 8a, and the structure of the cortex is shown in Figure 8b. Cells born on P12 were in the deepest part of the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate and at the border of the subplate. Layer 6 cells that were generated slightly later, on P16, were in the deeper part of the loosely packed zone, as they were at P35, whereas later born layer 6 cells and early-born layer 5 cells born on P28 had continued migrating from the intermedi-ate zone, the level that they had reached at P35, to reach the compact cell zone and the top of the loosely packed zone in the superficial cortical plate. Cells born at P36 near the end of the period for layer 5 generation and the beginning of the period for layer 4 generation had only just reached the intermediate zone and deep subplate on their way to the top of the cortical plate. The main change in connections between the cortex and the thalamus from the previous age illustrated is the presence of corticothalamic projections and the positions of cells that give rise to these projections see Sheng et al., 1991 marked by arrows in Fig. 8b . The superficial band of cells was in the compact cell zone at the top of the cortical plate and in the adjacent border region of the loosely packed zone, whereas the deeper cells occupied a wide band at the base of the cortical plate in the loosely packed zone. Comparison with the drawing of thymidine-labeled cells Fig. 8a shows that the deeper layer of cells project-ing to the thalamus are cells of layer 6. The more superfi- cial layer coincides with the position of late-born layer 6 cells and early-born layer 5 cells. Because these two separate layers of cells are seen at all ages when both the LGN and the lateral posterior nucleus LP are injected, and only the upper layer is seen when the LP is injected Sheng et al., 1991 , we conclude that it is the early-born layer 5 component of cells born at this age that comprises the superficial layer of corticothalamic projecting cells. cells identified by their birthdays at this age are shown in Figure 9a, and the structure of the cortex is shown in Figure 9b. At this age, early-born layer 4 cells and late-born layer 5 cells have reached the compact cell zone of the superficial cortical plate. All early-born layer 5 cells and late-born layer 6 cells had left this zone to reside at the top of the loosely packed zone, having been displaced inward by the arrival there of the early-born layer 4 cells and late-born layer 5 cells. Cells born on P12 and P16 were at the base of the loosely packed zone, similar to what was seen at the previous two ages discussed above. A few of these cells also were found in the subplate at this age, in contrast to the situation at younger ages. Within the former zone, cells born on P12 were no longer at the base of this zone with cells born on P16 above them, as at previous ages. Instead, both populations were mixed within the region. These findings suggest that there is a small amount of relative movement within these populations of cells with time as well as some displacement of a few of these cells into the subplate region. These cells presum-ably represent the few cells seen in the white matter close to the border of layer 6 at maturity. The positions of cells giving rise to corticothalamic projec-tions see Sheng et al., 1991 are indicated by arrows in Figure 9b. Two bands of cells projecting to the thalamus are seen the lower band at the base of the loosely packed zone coinciding with the position of identified layer 6 cells and the upper band at the top of the loosely packed zone coinciding with the position of identified layer 5 cells Fig. 9a . Position of identified cells at P65. P65 is the age at thalamus, first leave the compact cell zone to sit at the top of the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate Fig. 10a in the region containing thalamic afferents Sheng et al., 1991 . The laminar position of the cells that give rise to the projection to the LP see Sheng et al., 1991 is indicated by the upper arrow in Figure 10b. This band of cells is coincident with layer 5 cells identified by thymidine label-ing. Because of the arrival of early-born layer 4 cells and late-born layer 5 cells in the loosely packed zone, these cells have been displaced deeper into the loosely packed zone Fig. 10a . The lower arrow in Figure 10b indicates the position of cells that project to the LGN Sheng et al., 1991 . These cells can be identified as layer 6 cells both on the basis of thymidine labeling and because they resided in the cytoarchitectonically recognizable layer 6 Fig. 10b . Although layer 4 cells were now within the loosely packed zone among the thalamic afferents, the layer could not be recognized cytoarchitectonically. It can be recognized by P76, and, by P99, thalamic afferents have changed from their even distribution to become more concentrated over layer 4, as they are in the adult Sheng et al., 1991 .

Neurol. 416 319â334, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Protein kinases play a major role in regulating the development and function of the nervous system for review, see Levitan, 1994 Valtorta et al., 1996 Tokuda and Hatase, 1998 . Several cytoplasmic kinases, such as CAM-kinase and src, and receptor kinases, have been found at synapses. Some of these synapse-associated kinases are localized to the presynaptic terminal, others to the postsyn-aptic membrane or subsynaptic cytoplasm, and some are found both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Their functions include regulation of neurotransmitter receptor synthesis and anchoring, neurotransmitter receptor func-tion, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic morphology. An important step in elucidating the functions of such synapse-associated kinases is defining their location within synapses and the temporal pattern of their accumulation at synapses during development. LIM Kinase 1 LIMK1 is a cytoplasmic protein kinase identified in several screens for novel kinases expressed in the nervous system Bernard et al., 1994 Mizuno et al., 1994 Cheng and Robertson, 1995 Pro Â¨schel et al., 1995 . The name LIM Kinase 1 derives from the fact that LIMK1 is the first protein found to contain both LIM domains, which are zinc-finger motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions Dawid et al., 1998 and a kinase domain. On the basis of genetic evidence, LIMK1 hemizygosity was proposed as the cause of a cognitive defect seen in patients with Williams syndrome, but this association was recently questioned Tassabehji et al., 1999 . However, studies of cells transfected with LIMK1 have revealed several pos-sible roles for this kinase. Evidence from our laboratory demonstrates that LIMK1 can interact with the cytoplas-mic tail of neuregulins Wang et al., 1998 , suggesting that LIMK1 may regulate signaling by neuregulins NRGs . LIMK1 can also phosphorylate and inhibit the actin-binding protein cofilin Arber et al., 1998 Yang et al., 1998 . Cofilin severs actin filaments thus, inhibition of cofilin by LIMK1 could increase filamentous actin and or slow remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In a study of the interaction between LIMK1 and the NRG cytoplasmic tail, we discovered that LIMK1, like NRG, is present at adult neuromuscular synapses Wang et al., 1998 . Previously, LIMK1 immunoreactivity had been noted in the cytoplasm and nuclei of some neurons of the adult mouse brain Bernard et al., 1994 , but synaptic localization of LIMK1 has not been reported. Our finding that LIMK1 is present at adult neuromuscu-lar synapses raised a number of new questions, including whether LIMK1 is located in the presynaptic or postsynap-tic component of synapses, whether LIMK1 is also found at central synapses, and when during development it accumu-lates at synapses. Here we have used immunohistochemi-cal methods to answer these questions. We report that LIMK1 is concentrated in the presynaptic terminals of adult neuromuscular synapses and the presynaptic termi-nals of some synapses in the adult spinal cord. In contrast to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2, which reaches its adult levels in terminals before birth, LIMK1 immunoreactivity at embryonic and early postnatal synapses is near the background level. Similarly, LIMK1 accumulation at regen-erating synapses lags behind SV2. These findings suggest that LIMK1 regulates the structure and or function of adult presynaptic terminals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents SV2 and 2H3 hybridoma supernatants were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank main-tained by the University of Iowa Iowa City, IA rabbit anti-S100 antibody from Dako Carpinteria, CA fluores-cein-and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA fluorescein and Texas red a-bungarotoxin a-BTX from Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR horseradish peroxidase HRP -conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody from Pierce Rockford, IL and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit and the ABC Elite kit from Vector Burlingame, CA . Constructs and calculation of LIMK1-predicted molecular weight A LIMK1 expression construct was created by append-ing the myc-epitope tag onto the N-terminal end of the mouse LIMK1 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cDNA sequence as described in Wang et al. 1998 . The myc-LIMK1 cDNA encodes a protein of 661 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 73 kDa. Conceptual translation of the rat LIMK1 cDNA se-quence that was first isolated predicts that the rat LIMK1 protein is 647 amino acids in length Nunoue et al., 1995 . The predicted mass of this 647 amino acid polypeptide is 71 kDa, and in discussing our results, we explicitly con-sider only this mass. Somewhat smaller LIMK1 peptides might also be produced as a consequence of alternative splicing or translation initiation downstream of the 58-most AUG Bernard et al., 1994 Cheng and Robertson, 1995 Pro Â¨schel et al., 1995 . Recently, a cDNA encoding a LIMK1 form entirely lacking the kinase domain was isolated Edwards and Gill, 1999 . All of these possible variants, with the exception of the kinase-deleted form, contain the peptide sequence used to generate our LIMK1 antibody. Production of the LIMK1 antibody The LIMK1 antiserum LK1-EU1 was produced by immu-nizing a rabbit with the synthetic peptide a-acetyl-KETYRRGESSLPAHPEVPD conjugated to horseshoe crab hemocyanin H1757 Sigma, St. Louis, MO using glutaral-dehyde. The underlined amino acids correspond to the 18 C-terminal amino acids of the rat LIMK1 protein amino acids 630â647 of Genbank accession D31873 Nunoue et al., 1995 . Immunization and harvesting of serum were performed by Covance Research Products Denver, PA . Serum was affinity purified by using the immunizing peptide conjugated to Affigel 15 BioRad, Hercules, CA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The affinity-purified antibody preparation had an immunoglobulin concentration of 1.5 mg ml, as estimated from Coomassie blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS gels. This affin-ity-purified preparation was used for all of the experi-ments reported in this study. A preliminary characteriza-tion of the LK1-EU1 antibody has been reported Wang et al., 1998 . Animals and surgery Wistar Sprague-Dawley rats Harlan, Indianapolis, IN were used for all experiments. Ages of animals ranged from embryonic day 15 E15 5 15 days postcoitus to approximately P90 postnatal day 90 . Rats are born at E21âE22, become weanlings at approximately P21, and become adults sexually mature around P50â60. For surgery, 2-or 3-month-old male rats, weighing approxi-mately 400 g, were anesthetized with ketamine 8 mg kg and xylazine 12 mg kg . For nerve transection, the sciatic nerve was exposed in the upper thigh, and a 0.5-cm segment of the nerve was removed. The gastrocnemius muscle was harvested 5 days later. For regeneration studies, the sciatic nerve was crushed at midthigh level with no. 5 forceps. At various times after the crush, the soleus muscle was harvested. For transection of ventral and dorsal roots, the left L4 roots were exposed by using a dorsal approach. The ventral and dorsal roots were cut, and the left L4 dorsal root ganglion was removed. The spinal cord was harvested 5 or 10 days later, and sections were prepared from the L4 level of the cord. The unoper-ated leg muscle denervation experiments or unoperated side of the spinal cord transection of roots from the same rats was used as controls. All surgical procedures and animal handling were performed in accordance with Emory Universityâs guidelines for animal care. Tissue immunoblots Adult rats were killed by CO2 inhalation. Tissues of interest were immediately dissected, rinsed with 13 phos-phate-buffered saline PBS 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl , and frozen on dry ice. The tissues were then immersed in HNTE buffer 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% vol vol Triton X-100, 5 mM ethylenedi-aminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 10% vol vol glycerol and ââCompleteââ protease inhibitor cocktail [1 tablet 10 ml buffer Boehringer Mannheim] . The tissues were homog-enized by using a polytron model PT3000 Brinkmann . The homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 g for 20 minutes at 4Â°C to remove insoluble material, and the supernatants hereafter referred to as tissue lysates were transferred to fresh tubes. The protein concentration of the tissue lysates was analyzed by using the BioRad DC protein assay kit. For Western blotting, an aliquot of each tissue lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 23 SDS-1,4-dithiothreitol DTT sample buffer 23 5 6% wt vol SDS, 20% vol vol glycerol, 0.01% wt vol bromophenol blue,125mMTris-HCl,pH6.8,100mMDTT ,thesamplewas heated to 95Â°C for 5 minutes, and 40 Î¼g of total protein from each tissue lysate was loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described Wang et al., 1998 . The LK1-EU1 antibody was used at a final concentration of 0.75 Î¼g ml. For the peptide competition control, 3.75 Î¼g of LK1-EU1 was incubated with 15 Î¼g of immunizing peptide in a volume of 20 Î¼l for 2 hours at room temperature, and this mixture was used in place of the LK1-EU1 antibody in the immunoblot procedure final antibody concentration 5 0.75 Î¼g ml . Immunoprecipitation Tissue lysates were prepared in a nondenaturing lysis buffer as described above. Two hundred micrograms of brain lysate protein or 1 mg of spinal cord, kidney, or muscle lysate protein in a volume of 1 ml of HNTE buffer was used for each immunoprecipitation. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 10 Î¼g of rabbit IgG Sigma and 20 Î¼l of protein A-agarose Sigma for 1 hour at 4Â°C. The protein-A beads were then spun down at 700 g, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes contain-ing 5 Î¼g of LK1-EU1. After incubation for 1 hour at 4Â°C, 20 Î¼l of protein-A agarose was added to the tissue lysate antibody mixture and incubated on a rotator for 4 hours at 4Â°C. The beads were washed with HNTE buffer at room temperature 4 washes, 3 minutes each , and bound pro-tein was eluted by incubation in 50 Î¼l of 23 SDS-DTT sample buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature. The protein-A agarose beads were sedimented by centrifuga-tion, and the eluate was transferred to a clean tube. Before loading on the gel, the eluate was heated for 5 minutes at 95Â°C. Fifteen microliters of the eluate representing the precipitate from approximately 30% of the starting amount of tissue lysate was analyzed by immunoblot as previously described Wang et al., 1998 . For the peptide competition control, 5 Î¼g of LK1-EU1 was incubated with 15 Î¼g of the immunizing peptide in a volume of 20 Î¼l for 2 hours at room temperature. This mixture was then added to the precleared tissue lysates, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above final antibody concentra-tion 5 5 Î¼g ml . Fluorescence immunohistochemistry Rats were anesthetized with 4% wt vol chloral hydrate P21 and adult or ether P0âP14 and perfused through the heart with 4% wt vol paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Hindlimb muscles and spinal cord were dissected and immersed in 15% wt vol sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, until they sank, trans-ferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 2â3 days, and then frozen in OCT compound by using liquid nitrogen. To harvest embryonic tissue, a pregnant female rat was killed by CO2 inhalation, and embryos were removed to a 100-mm Petri dish containing PBS. The hindlimbs were dissected and immersed in 4% paraformal-dehyde in 0.1 M of sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, overnight at 4Â°C. The tissues were cryoprotected with sucrose and frozen in OCT compound as described above. Ten-microme-ter thick sections were cut in a cryostat and processed for immunohistochemistry as previously described Wang et al., 1998 . Antibody concentration or dilutions used for immunohis-tochemistry were as follows LK1-EU1, 1.5 Î¼g ml anti-SV2, 1 100 2H3, 1 1,000 S100, 1 200 lissamine rhoda-mine sulfonyl chloride LRSC -conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, 1 200 fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate FITC -conjugated donkey anti-mouse 1 200 and LRSC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, 1 200. Fluorescein a-BTX see Fig. 2 was used at 5 Î¼g ml. Texas-red a-BTX see Fig. 3 was used at 1 Î¼g ml. When used, a-BTX was applied with the secondary antibody. Note that in Figure 3, for the SV2 BTX double-label panels, Texas red a-BTX is displayed in green instead of the usual red, and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse is displayed in red. The specificity of LK1-EU1 label was tested by preincubating the antibody with the immunizing peptide for 2 hours at room temperature 10 Î¼g peptide per 1 Î¼g antibody in a volume of 20 Î¼l antibody peptide mixture diluted with PBS . This mixture was then applied to tissue sections as described above final antibody concentration 5 1.5 Î¼g ml . Sections were scanned by using a BioRad 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope BioRad coupled to a Zeiss Axioskop.A203 Plan-Neofluar NA0.5 , a 403 Plan-Neofluar NA0.75 ,anda633Plan-Apochromatoilimmersionlens NA 1.4 were used. A Z-series of images was collected for each preparation at a step of 0.5 Î¼m. The images shown in the figures were compiled from a stack of 10â20 individual Z-series images by using the BioRad Lasersharp software, except that in Figure 7A2 and B each panel shows a single Z-series image. Images were further processed by usingAdobe Photoshop. All images within a single figure were collected identically, and all images within a single figure showing the same fluorophore were processed identically. For each figure, images in the same row show the same section, and superim-position of red and green fluorescence is seen as yellow. Control experiments were performed in which sections were developed with only one primary antibody but with both secondary antibodies used for double labeling. Each primary antibody used was tested in this type of control experiment. These experiments demonstrated the absence of bleedthrough and cross-labeling. They also showed that, in the absence of appropriate primary antibody, no signal was produced by any of the secondary antibodies used. Subjective rating of LIMK1 and SV2 accumulation at neuromuscular synapses during postnatal development was performed as follows sections were double labeled with fluorescein-a-BTX and either LK1-EU1 or anti-SV2 antibody visualized by a rhodamine-conjugated secondary. At postnatal time points, essentially all AChR clusters in the normal rat hindlimb are at synapses see Results . Therefore, for purposes of this assessment, a synapse was defined as a cluster of acetylcholine receptors AChRs identified by a-BTX label. Each field was first examined with fluorescein optics to identify AChR clusters. The field was then examined with rhodamine optics, and the inten-sity of the LIMK1 or SV2 label that was colocalized with the clustered AChRs was scored. At each developmental age studied, at least 300 synapses were scored for colocal-ized LIMK1 label intensity and at least 95 synapses were scored for colocalized SV2 label intensity. The score as-signed was based on a subjective assessment of the aver-age brightness of the LIMK1 or SV2 label colocalized with the BTX label. Intensities were scored as ââStrong,ââ ââModerate,ââ ââWeak,ââ or ââNot detected.ââ The observer scor-ing these sections was not informed of the age of the animal from which each section was harvested. Immunoelectronmicroscopy Immunoelectronmicroscopy was performed as described elsewhere Gilmor et al., 1996 . The LK1-EU1 was used at 1.5 Î¼g ml. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary was used at 1 200. The avidin-biotin-complex method was used to visualize immunoreactivity. The peroxidase reaction product was developed in 0.05% diaminobenzidine DAB and 0.01% H2O2. The immunostained tissue was postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Eponate 12 Ted Pella, Redding, CA . The embedded tissue was thin sectioned at 50 nm on an ultramicrotome and examined by using a Hitachi H7500 electron microscope. DISCUSSION This study is the first to provide a detailed characteriza-tion of the distribution of LIMK1 protein within neurons of adult and developing animals. Our major findings are that LIMK1 is concentrated in presynaptic terminals of adult neuromuscular and spinal cord synapses and that LIMK1 accumulates in developing and regenerating nerve termi-nals long after these terminals establish contact with their targets. Our experiments also revealed developmental changes in the amount of LIMK1 along axons and in neuronal nuclei. LIMK1 protein-binding domains and kinase activity LIMK1, like a number of other synapse-associated pro-teins, has several domains that are likely to function in protein-protein binding. These include two LIM domains Sanchez-Garcia and Rabbitts, 1994 Dawid et al., 1995 Dawid et al., 1998 , a PDZ-like domain Bredt, 1998 Hata et al., 1998 , and a serine-proline-rich region. Several of the proteins already known to bind to LIMK1 are present in nerve terminals, including neuregulin Sandrock et al., 1995 Wang et al., 1998 , PKC isoforms Kuroda et al., 1996 Majewski et al., 1997 , and actin Hirokawa et al., 1989 Yang et al., 1998 . The kinase domain of LIMK1 can phosphorylate cofilin on serine 3 Arber et al., 1998 Rosenblatt and Mitchison, 1998 Yang et al., 1998 and thereby inhibit degradation of F-actin. When LIMK1 is expressed in differentiated PC12 cells, the actin cytoskeleton is dramatically altered. In PC12 cells that overexpress LIMK1, the growth cones on neurites are enlarged, and their F-actin content is increased. Con-versely, in PC12 cells transfected with a mutated form of LIMK1-lacking kinase activity, the growth cones are reduced in size Arber et al., 1998 . However, whether cofilin or related proteinssuchasactindepolymerizingfactor ADF couldserve asasubstrateofLIMK1innerveterminalsisunclear,because members of theADF cofilin family of actin-regulating proteins have not yet been reported in adult nerve terminals. LIMK1 binds to neuregulins through interaction of the LIM domain region of LIMK1 with the NRG cytoplasmic tail Wang et al., 1998 . NRGs have now been found both presynaptically and postsynaptically at the neuromuscu-lar synapse Burden, 1998 . Our finding that LIMK1 is a presynaptic terminal protein focuses further investigation of the NRG-LIMK1 interaction on the presynaptic side of synapses. If LIMK1 regulates actin in the nerve terminal, then alteration of the neuronal cytoskeleton may be a downstream effect of intercellular signaling initiated through the NRG cytoplasmic tail. Accumulation of LIMK1 at maturing synapses Although functional synapses first form in the rat hindlimb and spinal cord during embryonic development, these synapses gradually acquire their adult characteris-tics over the first few weeks after birth Conradi and Ronnevi, 1977 Dennis et al., 1981 Grinnell, 1995 Nguyen and Lichtman, 1996 Seebach and Mendell, 1996 . We have found that LIMK1 accumulates in the nerve terminals of these synapses roughly in parallel with this synaptic maturation. Many of the proteins involved in the functions of adult presynaptic terminals are already abundant in terminals within the first few days after they form synapses Lupa and Hall, 1989 Li and Dahlstrom, 1993 , suggesting that these proteins perform functions required by the imma-ture and the adult synapse. However, a few proteins present in adult nerve terminals accumulate later, as the synapse matures to its adult phenotype. Two such proteins are the guanosine triphosphate GTP -binding protein rab3a Stettler et al., 1994 and the SNAP-receptor bind-ing protein complexin Ono et al., 1998 . Perturbations in both rab3a and complexin function can modulate neuro-transmitter release, and each has been proposed to regu-late maturation of the transmitter release process Ober-hauser et al., 1992 Lledo et al., 1993 McMahon et al., 1995 Ono et al., 1998 . To our knowledge LIMK1 is the first kinase to join this small group of proteins known to become concentrated at synapses during their maturation. In contrast to the maturational increase in LIMK1, two growth-associated proteins, GAP-43 and CAP-23, have been shown to gradually decrease at neuromuscular syn-apses over the first few weeks after birth Caroni and Becker, 1992 Caroni et al., 1997 , and it has been sug-gested that this decline contributes to the reduction in morphological plasticity seen at maturing motoneuron terminals. Our findings suggest that LIMK1 plays a role in adult nerve terminals. We predict that the activities controlled by LIMK1 will appear or mature in presynaptic terminals during the period of LIMK1 accumulation. On the basis of these considerations and the finding that LIMK1 can regulate cofilin, two candidate functions of nerve terminal LIMK1 are regulation of the morphological plasticity of the nerve terminal and regulation of neurotransmitter release. Both of these aspects of nerve terminal physiology are known to change dramatically during the period over which LIMK1 accumulates in nerve terminals Balice-Gordon and Lichtman, 1990 Bazzy, 1994 Seebach and Mendell, 1996, and references therein . Furthermore, ac-tin filament turnover in synaptosomes and cultured neu-rons is regulated by depolarization, and the stabilization of synaptosomal actin filaments can affect neurotransmitter release Bernstein and Bamburg, 1985 Bernstein and Bamburg, 1989 Bernstein et al., 1998 . This raises the possibility that LIMK1-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton may govern some aspects of the nerve termi-nalâs response to electrical activity. In summary, LIMK1 accumulates in presynaptic termi-nals during synapse maturation, suggesting LIMK1 regu-lates activities of the nerve terminal that change during this maturational process. The time course of LIMK1âs accumulation in presynaptic terminals and its previously demonstrated effects on actin suggest a role for LIMK1 in the regulation of nerve terminal morphological stability and or neurotransmitter release. Now that LIMK1 has been identified as a nerve terminal protein, it will be important to determine the effects of perturbing LIMK1 function on nerve terminal biology. RESULTS Characterization of the LIMK1 antibody A LIMK1 antiserum, LK1-EU1, was raised by immuniz-ing a rabbit with a peptide corresponding to the carboxy- terminal amino acid sequence of rat and mouse LIMK1. The LK1-EU1 antibody preparation used in this study was affinity purified from this serum.ABLAST search Altschul et al., 1997 revealed no proteins other than LIMK1 with close sequence similarity to the peptide used for immuniza-tion. In particular, there is no sequence similarity between the immunizing peptide and the carboxy-terminal region of the LIMK1 homologue LIMK2 Nunoue et al., 1995 . The specificity of the LK1-EU1 antibody was tested in Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays. In Western blots, the antibody labeled a single band in lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with myc-LIMK1 Fig. 1A but labeled no bands in lysates of untransfected COS-7 cells Wang et al., 1998 . The antibody also labeled a single band in lysates of brain, but no proteins were labeled in lysates of skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, or liver Fig. 1B . Protein immunoprecipitated by the LK1-EU1 antibody from tissue lysates was also analyzed by Western blot. In immunopre-cipitates of brain and spinal cord, the antibody labeled a single band, but no bands were labeled in immunoprecipi-tates of skeletal muscle or kidney Fig. 1C . These results are consistent with previous reports that LIMK1 mRNA is more abundant in nervous system tissue than in other tissues Bernard et al., 1994 Mizuno et al., 1994 Cheng and Robertson, 1995 Okano et al., 1995 Pro Â¨schel et al., 1995 . Preincubation of the antibody with the peptide used for immunization abolished labeling on immunoblots Fig. 1A , blocked immunoprecipitation Fig. 1C , and abolished or markedly reduced immunohistochemical labeling inset in Fig. 2B2 . Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that LK1-EU1 specifically recognizes the LIMK1 protein. It may seem surprising that LIMK1 was not detected in muscle tissue, as we have observed LIMK1 immunoreactiv-ity at neuromuscular synapses Wang et al., 1998 see also Fig. 2 . However, because proteins in axons and at syn-apses constitute only a tiny percentage of the total protein in muscle, proteins present in relatively high concentra-tions at synapses may have a low concentration in muscle tissue lysates. Thus, proteins concentrated at the neuro-muscular synapse might be readily observed in immunohis-tochemical assays but still not detected in biochemical assays of muscle lysates. The apparent molecular weight of myc-LIMK1 in COS cell lysates is 73 kDa, the size predicted from the known rat LIMK1 cDNAsequence see Materials and Methods for discussion of predicted LIMK1 size . However, the appar-ent molecular weight of LIMK1 in rat brain and spinal cord lysates is 83 kDa Fig. 1 . No Western analysis of LIMK1 in brain or other tissues has previously been published. However, the identification of the 83-kDa band as LIMK1 has been confirmed by using an antibody raised against the N-terminal region of LIMK1 Falls et al., unpublished data . Possible reasons for the difference in mobility of COS cell and rat brain LIMK1 include posttrans-lational modifications, such as phosphorylation, or an alternatively spliced LIMK1 messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA encoding a larger protein. LIMK1 is concentrated in the presynaptic terminal at mature neuromuscular synapses We previously showed that LIMK1 is present at adult neuromuscular synapses Wang et al., 1998 . This finding raised the question of whether LIMK1 is contained within motoneuron terminals, postsynaptic muscle fibers, or the synapse-associated Schwann cells see Hall and Sanes, 1993 and references therein for discussion and illustration of neuromuscular synapse structure and development . To answer this question we used confocal immunomicroscopy to compare the distribution of LIMK1 at adult neuromus-cular synapses to the presynaptic terminal protein SV2 Buckley and Kelly, 1985 Lupa and Hall, 1989 , the postsynaptic membrane AChRs Dennis, 1981 Anderson et al., 1984 , and the Schwann cell protein S100 Woolf et al., 1992 Son and Thompson, 1995a Son and Thompson, 1995b Hirata et al., 1997 . The distribution of LIMK1 and SV2 at neuromuscular synapses appeared nearly identical Fig. 2A . In contrast, the distribution of LIMK1 was distinct from that of AChRs Fig. 2B and S100 compare Fig. 2A with Fig. 2C . These data indicate that most LIMK1 at neuromuscular syn-apses is in the presynaptic terminals, not in the postsynap-tic region of the muscle or in Schwann cells. Moreover, the precise alignment of the LIMK1 and SV2 immunoreactiv-ity suggests that LIMK1 is especially abundant near active zones, because synaptic vesicles within the nerve terminal are most abundant near the active zones for review, see Hall and Sanes, 1993 Burns and Augustine, 1995 . Denervation of hindlimb muscle was performed to fur-ther test the hypothesis that synaptic LIMK1 is princi-pally located in the presynaptic terminal. Labeling for LIMK1 and SV2 was dramatically reduced at synaptic sites within 5 days after denervation, but the AChR pattern at this time appeared similar to that of innervated synapses Fig. 2D SV2 result not shown . The nerve terminal is known to degenerate soon after denervation. Thus, the rapid disappearance of LIMK1 from the synaptic site is consistent with presynaptic localization of LIMK1, although it must be noted that this result alone does not exclude the possibility of postsynaptic localization Astrow et al., 1992 . To determine if LIMK1 is similarly abundant in axons and nerve terminals, sections of muscle were double labeled for LIMK1 and neurofilament-M NF-M , a cyto-skeletal component found along the length of motor axons, but not in their terminals Lupa and Hall, 1989 Lee and Cleveland, 1996 . LIMK1 label appeared much more in-tense in the presynaptic terminals than along the axons Fig. 2E , suggesting that LIMK1 is specifically trafficked to the presynaptic terminal of motoneurons. To assess the potential for LIMK1 involvement in neuro-muscular synapse formation and maturation, we exam-ined the accumulation of LIMK1 at developing neuromus-cular synapses and along intramuscular axons. In our studies, we compared the embryonic and postnatal distri-bution of LIMK1 to both AChRs Figs. 3 and 4 and SV2 Fig. 5 . Synapse formation, defined as colocalization of synaptic vesicle proteins and acetylcholine receptors, begins in the rat hindlimb around E18 Rubinstein and Kelly, 1981 Condon et al., 1990 . At E18, occasional small areas of overlap between SV2 and AChR label were observed, and most AChR clusters were near SV2-labeled axons Fig. 3A . At E20, strong SV2-label colocalized with most AChR clusters Fig. 3C , indicating that by E20 most AChR clusters are located at nascent synapses. Postnatally, strong SV2 label was colocalized with all clusters ofAChRs examined Fig. 4 . The relationship of AChR clusters to LIMK1 immunore-activity was quite different. At E18, LIMK1 was evident along portions of the intramuscular nerves, but few AChR clusters were found near LIMK1-labeled regions of these nerves Fig. 3B see also Fig. 5 E18 . At E20, only faint patches of LIMK1 immunoreactivity were observed, and there continued to be little overlap of the LIMK1 label with AChR label Fig. 3D and Fig. 4 . Postnatally, the intensity of LIMK1 label that overlapped AChR clusters increased only gradually. At P0 and P2 ,5% of the synapses exam-ined were even weakly LIMK1 immunoreactive. At P6 approximately 50% were weakly labeled, and a few per-cent were moderately labeled. The amount of labeling was greater at P14, but it was not until P21 that 50% of the synapses were strongly LIMK1 immunoreactive. Only in adults were most of the synapses examined strongly LIMK1 immunoreactive. In the experiments just described Figs. 3 and 4 , the distribution of LIMK1 relative to AChRs was assessed. To further define the accumulation of LIMK1 in the develop-ing neuromuscular system, we compared the distribution of LIMK1 to SV2. For these experiments, we first evalu-ated the changes that occur in SV2 distribution during hindlimb neuromuscular development. Before the forma-tion of neuromuscular synapses, and also during the early stages of synaptogenesis, SV2 was observed along the length of intramuscular axons Fig. 3A and C Fig. 5 E15 and E18 . Subsequently, SV2 immunoreactivity became progressively more restricted, until by P21, SV2 was found only within the presynaptic terminal and the immediately adjacent preterminal axon not shown . Similar observa-tions for the progressive restriction of SV2 immunoreactiv-ity to the synapse have previously been reported in a study of neuromuscular synapse formation in the mouse dia-phragm Lupa and Hall, 1989 . Comparison of the distribution of LIMK1 with SV2 at different developmental stages revealed expression of LIMK1 both along axons and at synapses. These two aspects of LIMK1 neuromuscular expression had different time courses. The expression along axons was most promi-nent at E15, the first age we examined Fig. 5 E15 . After E15, LIMK1 immunoreactivity along intramuscular axons rapidly declined Fig. 5 E18 and remained low at all later stages examined see Fig. 2E . It is not yet clear if the LIMK1 that is distributed along embryonic axons is within the axoplasm, or if instead it is expressed in Schwann cells or other cells of the peripheral nerve. The expression of LIMK1 in presynaptic terminals was first observed much later in development. At E18, when synapses are initially forming, presynaptic terminals can-not unequivocally be identified by the pattern of SV2 label see Fig. 3A . However, little or no LIMK1 immunoreactiv-ity was observed in the distal portions of the SV2-labeled axonal arbors, suggesting that levels of LIMK1 are low in nerve terminals at this stage Fig. 5 E18 . By E20, and at subsequent stages, nerve terminals can be clearly identi-fied by the pattern of SV2 label see Fig. 3C . At E20 and also at P0, LIMK1 immunoreactivity was not readily detected at nerve terminals Fig. 5 E20 and P0 . However, by P6 small spots of faint LIMK1 label were observed at some nerve terminals Fig. 5 P6 . LIMK1 label at nerve terminals gradually increased over the first postnatal weeks, but adult levels were not reached until after P14 Fig. 5 P14, P21, and adult . These data Figs. 3â5 demonstrate that the principal accumulation of LIMK1 at neuromuscular synapses occurs over the first several weeks after birth and that the levels of LIMK1 are low when synapses are first formed, relative to the levels in the adult. LIMK1 at regenerating neuromuscular synapses To determine if the delayed appearance of LIMK1 at developing neuromuscular synapses was related to the developmental state of the motor axon terminal or of the muscle, we examined the expression of LIMK1 in muscles at various times after crushing the sciatic nerve Fig. 6 . After a crush injury to the nerve, the injured axons degenerate distal to the crush. Subsequently, synapses are regenerated at the former synaptic sites by axons growing through the crush and down the remaining nerve sheath see Rich and Lichtman, 1989, and references therein for discussion of reinnervation of neuromuscular synapses . Five days after nerve crush, little LIMK1 immunoreac-tivity remained at former synaptic sites Fig. 6 , and SV2 label could not be detected data not shown . This loss of SV2 immunoreactivity indicates the loss of the presynap-tic terminal after the crush. By 9 days after nerve crush, SV2-positive terminal arborizations could be found, but only rare, faint spots of LIMK1 immunoreactivity were detected at these newly regenerated synapses. Increasing LIMK1 expression at regenerating synapses was evident by 14 days after nerve crush, and by 23 days LIMK1 expression had returned to its normal adult levels. The pattern of LIMK1 label in presynaptic terminals 9 and 14 days after the crush is reminiscent of the pattern seen at developing synapses 6 and 14 days after birth, respectively see Fig. 5 . No increase in axonal LIMK1 immunoreactiv-ity accompanied the reaccumulation of synaptic LIMK1 at any of the time points examined Fig. 6 . Thus, as during postnatal development, the expression of LIMK1 in regen-erating motor nerve terminals lagged 1â2 weeks behind LIMK1 is concentrated in presynaptic terminals of the adult spinal cord Our finding that LIMK1 is concentrated at the neuromus-cular synapse encouraged us to investigate whether LIMK1 is also concentrated at central synapses. We have focused our analysis on the synapses around large cells in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. On the basis of their size and position, many of these cells are likely to be a-motoneu-rons see Burke, 1998 Walmsley et al., 1998, and refer-ences therein for discussion and illustration of ventral horn cellular and synaptic anatomy . By using electron and confocal immunomicroscopy, we found that LIMK1 immunoreactivity is concentrated in some, but not all, of the presynaptic terminals forming synapses in the adult ventral spinal cord Figs. 7 and Fig. 8 Adult . LIMK1-immunoreactive terminals were observed to form syn-apses both on the soma of neurons Fig. 7B and C and on dendrites Fig. 7D and E . Some dendrites were observed to receive inputs from both labeled and unlabeled termi-nals Fig. 7D and E . Analysis of spinal cord segments that had been injured by transection of the ventral and dorsal roots further supported the hypothesis that LIMK1 is concentrated in presynaptic terminals of central synapses. In the intact adult spinal cord, a dense, nearly continuous collar of SV2-labeled synaptic boutons outlined the large neurons of the ventral horn Fig. 7B and Fig. 8 Adult . Some, but not all, of these boutons also showed strong LIMK1 label. After transection of ventral and dorsal roots, the number of LIMK1-and SV2-immunoreactive boutons outlining the perimeter of large neurons in the affected segments was substantially reduced Fig. 8 Lesioned . This result is consistent with the well-documented withdrawal or ââstrip-pingââ of presynaptic terminals from the surface of axoto-mized motoneurons Watson, 1974 Matthews and Nelson, 1975 Mendell et al., 1976 Eugene and Taxi, 1991 and further supports the idea that the punctate LIMK1 label along the surface of uninjured motoneurons represents the concentration of LIMK1 in presynaptic terminals. Having established that LIMK1 is concentrated in pre-synaptic terminals of the adult ventral spinal cord, we investigated the time course of LIMK1 accumulation in these presynaptic terminals. In the first days after birth, few SV2-labeled boutons in the ventral spinal cord showed detectable LIMK1 immunoreactivity Fig. 8, P0 and P6 . The intensity of LIMK1 label that was colocalized with SV2-labeled boutons increased only gradually, similar to the gradual postnatal increase at developing neuromuscu-lar synapses. By P14, many boutons showed weak LIMK1 immunoreactivity, and some boutons were strongly immu-noreactive. However, even at P14 Fig. 8 and P21 not shown , LIMK1 label in boutons appeared less intense than in the adult. An additional finding from these studies was that the cytoplasm and nucleus of motoneurons in the adult are LIMK1 immunoreactive Figs. 7 and 8 . Identification of LIMK1 protein within the soma of motoneurons was not entirely unexpected, because in situ hybridization studies had previously demonstrated relatively high amounts of LIMK1 mRNA in large neurons of the ventral spinal cord Pro Â¨schel et al., 1995 Mori et al., 1997 , and we had found LIMK1 at motoneuron terminals Fig. 2 . However, not all proteins synthesized by motoneurons are easily detected in the soma. For example, we observed little SV2 immuno-reactivity in the motoneuron cell body Figs. 7 and 8 . Thus, although SV2 and LIMK1 are trafficked to a similar location within the motoneuron terminal, their relative abundance in the terminal and soma is different. LIMK1 accumulated in motoneuron nuclei with a time course that roughly paralleled its accumulation in motoneu-ron terminals and synapses of the ventral horn. Although at P0, the cytoplasm of motoneurons was strongly LIMK1 immunoreactive, LIMK1 label was not seen in motoneuron nuclei at this stage Fig. 8 . The concentration of LIMK1 in the nucleus gradually increased over the first few weeks after birth, until by P14 the intensity of LIMK1 immunore-activity was similar in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

P84 is a multifunctional immunoglobulin family mem-ber that is expressed widely in the central nervous system CNS , immune system, and other tissues Chuang and Lagenaur, 1990 Comu et al., 1997 . Cytoplasmic domains of P84 and related molecules SH2-domain-containing pro-tein tyrosine phosphatase substrate 1 SHPS-1 , brain immunoglobulin-like molecule with tyrosine-based motifs BIT , and signal-regulatory proteins SIRPs are known to bind cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatases Fujoika et al., 1996 Ohnishi et al., 1996 Comu et al., 1997 Kharitonen-kov et al., 1997 . These membrane proteins and the corresponding SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases primarily SHP-1 in macrophage and SHP-2 in nonhematopoeitic cells appear to play a role in regula-tion of the signaling pathways of several growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and neurotrophins Fujioka et al., 1996 . The extra-cellular domain of P84 contains three immunoglobulin-related domains and mediates heterophilic adhesion, sug-gesting that P84 may be involved in localizing signaling activities to specific sites of cell adhesion Fujioka et al., 1996 Comu et al., 1997 . The predominant extracellular ligand for P84 is IAP, also known as CD47 Jiang et al., 1999 . As with P84, IAP is expressed in the CNS, the immune system, and other tissues Reinhold et al., 1995 . In some tissues, IAP is associated with aVb3 integrins that mediate other adhesive relationships Brown et al., 1990 . Both P84 and IAP expression are associated with syn-apse rich areas, such as the molecular layer and synapatic glomeruli of the cerebellum and the plexiform layers of the retina Chuang and Lagenaur, 1990 Comu et al., 1997 Jiang et al., 1999 . Although these studies are suggestive of a synaptic association of P84 and IAP, they have not clearly demonstrated any proximal associations with sites of synaptic release. To address such questions, we exam-ined the expression of P84 and IAP protein and associated messenger RNA in mouse retina in developing and mature retina. We have also examined P84 expression in IAP-null mice. Developmental studies showed that both molecules are strongly expressed in the inner plexiform layer IPL and outer plexiform layer OPL , where synapses are located. Ultrastructural studies revealed P84 and IAP at ribbon synapses in the OPL. In situ hybridization showed that P84 but not IAP mRNAwas expressed by photorecep-tor cells. Retinae from transgenic IAP-null mice did not exhibit the synaptic localization of P84 typical of normal controls, suggesting that IAP expression is responsible for synaptic localization of P84. In addition to the synapse-associated distribution, P84 and IAP expression was also seen in certain extrasynaptic locations, indicating the possibility of multiple roles for the two molecules. MATERIALS AND METHODS All experiments were conducted in accordance with the University guidelines and with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals. Immunocytochemistry Light microscopy. C57BL 6 3 129 hybrid of C57BL 6 and 129 in the University of Pittsburghâs animal facility or IAP-null mice that had been ninefold back-crossed onto a balb c background Lindberg et al., 1996 were used in these studies. Controls for experiments with the trans-genic mice were normal balb c that had been back-crossed for nine generations. For regular cryostat immunostain-ing, animals of postnatal day 1 P1 , P7, P14, and P30 were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer PB 0.1 M NaHPO4, pH 7.4 . The retinae and optic nerves were dissected out and postfixed in same fixative for 1â5 hours, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB pH 7.4 overnight. Sagittal sections of retina and optic nerve were cut on a cryostat at 10 Î¼m and processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously Mi et al., 1998 . For these studies the antibodies anti-P84 and anti-IAP mIAP 301 were used. The specificity of P84 has been described by Chuang and Lagenaur 1990 and that of mIAP 301 by Lindberg et al. 1993 . Briefly, sections were treated with blocking solution containing 10% horse serum for 30 minutes and incubated in undiluted anti-P84 or anti-IAP hybridoma culture supernatant containing 0.1% NP40 for 1 hour at room temperature. The antigen-antibody binding was visualized by fluorescein isothiocya-nate FITC or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies Cap-pel and Jackson Laboratories . Electron microscopy. Our developmental study showed that both P84 and IAP were expressed in the retinea of developing and mature mice in a similar pat-tern, so we conducted the EM study only on mature retinea for their well-defined ribbon synaptic structures. Animals were deeply anesthetized pentobarbital sodium, 100 mg kg i.p and perfused transcardially with 20 ml normal saline followed by 80 ml 4% paraformaldehyde. Eyes were post-fixed in the same fixative overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB pH 7.4 for 48 hours. Cryostat sections of retina 50 Î¼m were collected in cryoprotectant 30% sucrose, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 30% ethylene gly-col and washed five times in PBS pH 7.4 . Sections then were treated with 0.05% NP40 for 1 hour prior to the blocking buffer treatment. After 1 hour of blocking, sec-tions were incubated in P84 and IAP monoclonal antibody for 48 hours at 4Â°C with constant agitation. The antibody bindings were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with nickel intensified diaminoben-zidine. Immunostained sections were then further fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide in PB pH 7.4 , dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and infiltrated with EMbed 812 Epon, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA prior to flat embedding between two slides. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert ultramicrotome and examined under a Jeol 100-CX electron microscope without further counter stain-ing. Control sections were treated in the same manner, except primary antibodies were omitted for both light and electron microscopy studies. In situ hybridization P14 mouse retinae exhibited an adult-like immunostain-ing pattern with anti-P84 and anti-IAP. Because P14 mouse retina expressed high levels of P84 and IAP messen-ger RNA, this was selected for in situ hybridization studies. The animals were deeply anesthetized and enucle-ated. The retinae were immediately immersed in OCT Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN , snap frozen in dry ice-cooled alcohol, and stored at 280Â°C until use. Retinal sagittal sections were cut at 10 Î¼m on a cryostat and processed for in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes for P84 as previously described Comu et al., 1997 . In the case of IAP, a PCR-amplified full-length IAP cDNA was subcloned into PGEM-teasy vector Promega, Madison, WI . Two clones with reverse directions of IAP cDNA sense and antisense were ob-tained. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense ribo-probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase. Hybridization with tissue sections essentially followed the protocol of Schaeren-Wiener and Gerfin- Moser 1993 . Control sections were hybridized with sense probes. Image processing All light microscopic pictures were acquired using a Sensys digital camera with IPlab 3.2 software and edited with Photoshop 4.0. DISCUSSION Here we have described the retinal expression of two membrane receptors that bind to one another, P84 and IAP. P84 and its homologues SHPS-1, SIRP, and BIT become phosphorylated in response to growth factor activa-tion of receptor tyrosine kinases. This phosphorylation promotes the binding of phosphatase SHP-2, which in turn may inhibit or activate the growth factor signaling cascade Fujioka et al., 1996 Ohnishi et al., 1996 Kharitonenkov et al., 1997 . IAP is known to associate with integrins within the plane of the membrane and with Gi, the inhibitory subclass of G-proteins Lindberg et al., 1993 Frazier et al., 1999 . Although a great deal is known about the signaling function of each of these molecules in nonneu-ronal cells, their roles in the nervous system at synaptic sites remain unclear. The colocalization of the two mol-ecules at synaptic sites in the retinal plexiform layers and the pattern of cellular expression of message for the two molecules suggest that they are in contact at these sites in the adult. The developmental expressions of P84 and IAP are quite distinct. In the retinal cells that express IAP, expression apparently begins prior to birth. In contrast, P84 expression begins only at birth, with strong expres-sion achieved by the end of the first postnatal week. Both P84 and IAP initially are expressed both in neuropil and around cell bodies and become localized closely to synaptic sites only as synaptogenesis occurs. One possible explana-tion of this expression pattern is that each molecule may be first inserted into the plasma membrane and then recruited to synaptic sites as they form. The observation that P84 failed to be so exclusively localized to synaptic sites in IAP-null mice supports the idea that at least P84 localization is dependent on proper expression of IAP. The interactions that initially lead to IAP localization at syn-apses remain unknown. Because the distribution of P84 is different in the IAP-null animals from that in normal animals, it is difficult to determine whether the absolute levels of P84 in plexiform layers in the IAP-null retinae are greater or lesser than in wild-type retinae. The synaptic localizations of P84 and IAP suggest that they may be involved in modulation of synaptic function. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of Huang et al. 1998 that IAP expression is associated with memory and learning. Those studies demonstrated that depressed levels of IAP in rat hippocampus are associated with poor memory retention. Although similar studies are not yet available for P84, it is known that P84 and homologous molecules are involved in receptor and nonreceptor tyro-sine kinase signaling Kharitonenkov et al., 1997 Yamao et al., 1997 . BIT, which is identical to P84, can be phosphorylated in response to treatment of PC12 cells or cultured neurons with nerve growth factor NGF , brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF , and neurotrophin-3 NT-3 Ohnishi et al., 1999 . Neurotrophins are known to modulate synaptic function in hippocampal and cortical neurons Kim et al., 1994 Lessmann et al., 1994 Kang and Schuman, 1995 Levine et al., 1995 . Thus P84 may modulate the response of synapses to neurotrophins. Also unclear is how the interaction of P84 with IAP may modify the functions of each of the molecules. Although both P84 and IAP are widely expressed in the CNS, each is ex-pressed in only subsets of neurons. In the retina, photore-ceptors express only P84.Amacrine, ganglion, and horizon-tal but not bipolar cells express IAP. Though IAP and P84 expression is clearly limited to subclasses of neurons, there does not appear to be a simple correlation with known subclasses of synapses. It has been shown that the IAP is associated with integrins in some but not all nonneural tissues, although this association has not been examined in the nervous system Brown et al., 1990 . Insofar as a variety of integrins have been identified in the CNS Pinkstaff et al., 1999 and some of them have been found at the sites of central synapses Einheber et al., 1996 Nishimura et al., 1998 , it is possible that synaptic IAP in the retina is associated with one or more integrins. In addition to the strong expression of P84 and IAP at synaptic sites, each molecule exhibits some degree of extrasynaptic expression. IAP is strongly expressed on ganglion cell axons and in the optic nerve during develop-ment. This expression persists in the optic fiber layer in adults but is reduced in the myelinated optic nerve. P84 is expressed weakly on ganglion cell axons and is also weakly detectable on some neuronal cell bodies adjacent to the IPL and OPL. The location of the weak extrasynaptic expres-sion of P84 is similar to that seen during development. Extrasynaptic P84 and IAP may represent activities of these molecules that are not related to synaptic function. The studies of Huang et al. 1998 have implicated IAP expression in synaptic function within the hippocampus. Specifically, it was shown that antisense oligonucleotides that blocked IAP expression were able to reduce long-term potentiation LTP in the rat hippocampus. The present study offers evidence that IAP binds to P84 at many synapses and that loss of IAP affects P84 distribution. It will be important to determine whether P84 is also in-volved in LTP or whether interactions between IAP and P84 modulate this or other synaptic phenomena. RESULTS Developmental expression of P84 and IAP Sagittal sections of retina and optic nerve of P1, P7, P14, and P30 mice were stained with P84 and IAP monoclonal antibodies.Around birth, only weak P84 immunoreactivity was detected in the retina and optic nerve Fig. 1A,C . P84 staining was seen in the developing IPL and the future OPL. At this period, the staining extended throughout the outer region of the neuroblastic layer Fig. 1C . P84 in the optic nerve and optic fiber layer was associated with nonoriented fibers typical of glial cells Fig. 1A . This was especially prominent around the optic nerve disc. At higher magnification, P84 staining was found on cells with small cell bodies and multiple short processes in the optic fiber layer arrow in Fig. 1C . These may be microglial cells or astrocytes. In contrast, strong IAP staining was already seen in the IPL, optic fiber layer of the retina, and optic nerve proper at this age. The staining of IAP in the optic fiber layer and optic nerve was predominantly associated with ganglion cell axons, although the glial components in the optic fiber layer were also IAP-positive Fig. 1B,D . Despite the higher level of IAP expression in the IPL and on ganglion cell axons, IAP was not detected in the outer part of the retina, as with P84, until postnatal day 4 data not shown . A week later, at P7, the expression pattern of P84 and IAP in retina looked quite similar, with both molecules concentrated in both plexiform layers of the retina and both expressed in the optic fiber layer and optic nerve Fig. 2AâD . There was some difference in the patterns of the two molecules in the optic fiber layer and optic nerve, P84 staining being less well-oriented along the axis of the optic fibers than IAP Fig. 2A,B . By P14, the expression of both molecules in OPL and IPL increased dramatically while the P84 staining in optic fiber layer decreased Fig. 3AâD . IAP was still expressed at a relatively high level on ganglion cell axons Fig. 3D . In mature animals, the staining pattern of the P84 and IAP in the retina and optic nerve looked almost identical Fig. 4AâD , with both molecules expressed strongly in the IPL and OPL. The staining in the OPL appeared as numerous small dots, and intense bands of sublaminar staining were apparent in the Localization of P84 and IAP in the outer plexiform layer To identify P84 and IAP staining in the OPL further, we conducted preembedding electron microscopic immunocy-tochemistry.At the ultrastructural level, both P84 and IAP were localized along the sites of contact of invaginating processes in photoreceptor terminals. As is shown in Figure 5, P84 expression was predominantly associated with ribbon synapses, although staining of other regions of neuropil could also be seen. The association of IAP with ribbon synapses was similar to that of P84, though IAP was seen in extrasynaptic neuropil to a somewhat greater extent than was P84 Fig. 6 . Both P84 and IAP were detected in rod synaptic spherules and in cone pedicles. Although it was clear that both P84 and IAP were associ- ated with synaptic ribbons in the OPL, the thickness of the peroxidase product made it difficult to assign staining exclusively to pre-or postsynaptic elements. Localization of P84 and IAP messenger RNA The above studies have shown that both P84 and IAP were localized at the sites of photoreceptor synapses. However, it was not clear which cells contributed to the staining seen at the synaptic site. To address this question, we performed in situ hybridization to localize P84 and IAP messenger RNAin the retina. P84 mRNAwas expressed in all three layers that contain cell bodies in the retina Fig. 7A . In the outer nuclear layer where photoreceptor cell bodies are located, P84 mRNA hybridization product was most abundant in the outer portion of the layer where cone photoreceptors are located. P84 message was, however, clearly detected in rod photoreceptors as well. In the inner nuclear layer, all cells appeared to express P84 transcripts. In both layers, P84 mRNA hybridization product was associated with cytoplasm. In addition, P84 mRNA was also present in the ganglion cell layer. IAP mRNA was expressed by a group of the cells located in the inner nuclear layer immediately adjacent to the OPL Fig. 7B,C . The position and morphology of these cells suggest that they are horizontal cells. IAP mRNA was also seen in cells located in the innermost portion of the inner nuclear layer. These are mainly amacrine cells. A striking difference in P84 and IAP mRNAexpression in retina is that IAP mRNA was not found in the photoreceptor cells, indicating that the IAP immunostaining seen in OPL was contributed exclusively by postsynaptic elements. Although P84 mes-sage in photoreceptors suggested that P84 must be presyn-aptic, we could not rule out the possibility that P84 is also postsynaptic, insofar as all INL cells appear to express P84 expression in IAP-null retinae IAP is expressed in the retina earlier than P84. P84 and IAP bind to one another, so it was possible that IAP influenced P84 expression. To explore this possibility we examined the expression of P84 in the retinae of adult IAP-null mice Lindberg et al., 1996 . In contrast to the distinct synapse-associated P84 staining in normal adult retina, IAP-null mice exhibited staining throughout the cellular and plexiform layers of their retinae Fig. 8A,B . In addition to abnormal expression around cell somas, P84 was also abnormally expressed in the photoreceptor inner segments in the IAP-null mice. No difference could be detected between normal and IAP-null retinae with Nissl staining or with antisynaptophysin staining not shown , indicating that there was not a general disruption of retinal architecture.

The ocelli, or simple eyes, of adult insects are associated with some of the largest neurons in the arthropod nervous system. In locusts, for example, the axons of six or seven large, second-order neurons L-neurons connect each ocel-lus with the brain Goodman, 1976 , and some of the widest axons in the nerve cord belong to third-order ocellar neurons. The third-order neurons integrate information from the ocelli with information from other sense organs and play a role in stabilising flight attitude with respect to the visual horizon Simmons, 1980 Griss and Rowell, 1986 Rowell and Reichert, 1986 . L-neurons convey sig-nals as graded changes in membrane potential Wilson, 1978 and make excitatory connections that convey either slow or sustained changes in membrane potential to the third-order neurons Simmons, 1981 . In addition, each lateral ocellar neuron L1â3 makes connections with other L-neurons it excites neurons L4â5 and inhibits the other two L1â3 neurons Simmons, 1982b . The inhibitory con-nections do not convey sustained changes in membrane potential but only operate when the presynaptic neuron depolarises quickly Simmons, 1985 . Electron microscopy has confirmed that these output connections from L1â3 are monosynaptic excitatory synapses onto both third-order neurons Simmons and Littlewood, 1989 and L4â5 Little-wood and Simmons, 1992 are made from the axons of L1â3 in the ocellar tract, and the inhibitory synapses occur in the overlapping terminal arbours in the protocerebrum Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . There is good evidence, both from pharmacology Sim-mons and Hardie, 1988 and immunocytochemistry re-viewed by Na Â¨ssel, 1999 , that the ocellar photoreceptors employ histamine as a neurotransmitter, like their counter-parts in the compound eye Hardie, 1987 . In dragonflies, from which intracellular recordings from L-neurons were first made, it was proposed that L-neurons release gamma- aminobutyric acid GABA and that this feeds back to photoreceptors, enhancing the phasic response by L-neurons to step increases in light Klingman and Chappell, 1978 . However, in locusts, the axons of some of the smaller neurons of the ocellar nerves and tracts stain positively with an antibody raised against GABA, whereas L-neurons in fact do not Ammermu Â¨ller and Weiler, 1985 . In addition, dual intracellular recordings from photorecep-tors and L-neurons in dragonflies Simmons, 1982a and locusts Simmons, 1985 have failed to find support for feedback synapses from L-neurons onto photoreceptors. In this work, we present evidence from three different staining techniques that locust L-neurons employ acetyl-choline as a neurotransmitter. First, at the light micro-scope level, we found that the axons of L-neurons stain with an antibody raised against a conjugated form of choline. Previously, the same technique has revealed that a few cell bodies, of unidentified neurons, stain in the protocerebrum of the locust brain Geffard et al., 1985a . Second, we found consistent staining of ocellar L-neurons using a polyclonal antiserum against choline acetyltrans-ferase ChAT . Third, using electron microscopy, we have also found positive staining for acetylcholinesterase in extracellular sites at locations where L-neurons make output synapses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Immunocytochemical demonstration of acetylcholine The adult locusts used in these experiments were taken from our crowded culture of Schistocerca gregaria. Twelve locusts were used for immunocytochemical demonstration of conjugated acetylcholine, using a polyclonal anti-conjugated acetylcholine antiserum kindly donated by Dr. M. Geffard INSERM, Talence, France . The antibody was raised in rabbits against choline conjugated to a mixture of proteins Geffard et al., 1985a . In order for this antibody to bind to tissue acetylcholine, acetylcholine needs to be cleaved to generate choline, which is then coupled to tissue proteins by aldehyde fixation. A method of cleavage of acetylcholine using allyl alcohol was first described by Geffard et al. 1985a,b and used to localise choline-like immunoreactivity in the locust Geffard et al., 1985a , rat Geffard et al., 1985b , and crayfish Wang-Bennett et al., 1988, 1989 . Subsequently, Chagnaud et al. 1989 intro-duced an improved primary fixative solution based on nitrobenzyl alcohol and glutaraldehyde, which we used in this study. The brains were dissected in insect saline i.e., 180 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2 in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 6.8, cooled to 4Â°C and fixed for 1 minute in a solution containing 0.1 M 2-nitrobenzyl alcohol Ald-rich, Dorset, UK , 0.5 M glutaraldehyde, 1% sodium meta-bisulphite, and 0.01 M sodium bromide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 10.7. The tissue was then post-fixed for 2 hours in a buffered 0.5 M glutaraldehyde solution pH 7.5 , rinsed, and embedded in 20% gelatine. Vibratome sections were taken at approximately 50-Î¼m thickness in either a horizontal or frontal plane. Free-floating sections were pre-incubated for 1 hour at room temperature usually 20Â°C in 0.013 M phosphate-buffered saline solution PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.8% serum albumin, 0.1 M lysine, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Afterward, the sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C in rabbit polyclonal anti-conjugated choline antise- rum diluted 1 2,000â1 8,000 . The sections were then rinsed in PBS, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in biotinylated goat-anti rabbit IgG H 1 L, diluted 1 250, Vector, Burlingame, CA , rinsed, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase streptavi-din conjugate diluted 1 250, Vector . After another rinse, the sections were incubated for 15 minutes in 1 mg ml diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride DAB DAKO, Cam-bridge, UK . The DAB solution contained 0.012% ammo-nium nickel sulphate to enhance sensitivity Tago et al., 1986 . H2O2 was then added to make up a 0.02% H2O2 solution, and the sections were incubated for 15 minutes and rinsed. Sections were left overnight to dry and stick to slides pre-coated with chrome-alum gelatine, then dehy-drated, and mounted in Histomount. They were examined and photographed with a light microscope under differen-tial interference contrast optics. Two specimens were used as controls, in which consecu-tive sections were treated as follows. The first was stained with the immunohistochemical procedure described above, using the primary antiserum at 1 5,000 dilution. The second was treated in the same way except that the primary antiserum was omitted, resulting in total suppres-sion of staining. The third section was stained using a primary antibody preadsorbed to a choline-glutaryl bovine serum albumin BSA conjugate gift of Dr. M. Geffard, Talence, France , at 1 5,000 dilution. As choline-glutaryl BSA is one of three conjugates used for immunisation during the production of the antibody Geffard et al., 1985a,b , most specific reaction should be eliminated by this procedure. As expected, staining was greatly reduced using this preadsorption. To compare staining density between the preadsorption control and the normal proce-dure, images were digitised using a cooled, charge-coupled device camera, and optical density measurements were made using image software Scion Image, Scion Corpora-tion, Frederick, MD . The mean optical density was mea-sured over the area covered by the lateral ocellar tracts on three such consecutive sections and subtracted from back-ground optical density measured over the same area near the section. When the primary antibody had been treated by pre-adsorption to choline-glutaryl-BSA, the optical density was reduced by 66% average of three measure-ments . The antiserum used has also been characterised previously and shown to stain specifically for conjugated choline Geffard et al., 1985a,b . Immunocytochemical detection of choline acetyltransferase We used two different antisera raised against ChAT. The first antiserum was a polyclonal antiserum against rat ChAT Ab 143, Chemicon, Temecula, CA that was raised in the rabbit but has also been shown to stain spider neurons expressing ChAT Fabian and Seyfarth, 1997 , and the second was a monoclonal antiserum against Drosophila ChAT kind gift of Dr. P. Salvaterra, City of Hope, CA , raised in the mouse Takagawa and Salvaterra, 1996 . We found specific staining of neurons in the locust brain only with the polyclonal antibody. To test whether each antibody binds to locust ChAT, we therefore per-formed Western blots. For Western blotting, two locust brains were dissected in saline solution and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the specimens were homogenised in buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulphate, glycerol, urea, and mercaptoethanol, and proteins were separated with electro- phoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and then blotted onto nitrocellulose exactly as described in Anderson and Davi-son 1999 . Using the polyclonal antiserum at 1 750 dilu-tion, and the monoclonal antiserum at 0.5 Î¼g ml dilution, the blots were immunolabelled with horseradish peroxi-dase-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAB as a chro-mogen method as in Anderson and Davison, 1999 . The approximate molecular weights of the bands were deter-mined using a band of homogenised human muscle tissue and a cocktail of antisera against proteins of standard molecular weights. For immunocytochemistry, nine brain specimens were dissected in cold insect saline, and fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaral-dehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. This was followed by fixation for 90 minutes at 4Â°C in 2% paraformal-dehyde in the same buffer specimens were then incubated overnight in a 25% sucrose solution in the same buffer. Specimens were embedded in gelatine, and vibratome sections were produced and stained in the same way as described for detection of conjugated choline, but using the polyclonal rabbit anti-ChAT antiserum at 1 1,500 dilution instead of the antiserum against conjugated choline. Con-trol sections in which the primary antiserum had been omitted remained free of staining. Histochemical demonstration of acetylcholinesterase Acetylcholinesterase was located as a precipitate of copper sulphide Butcher, 1983 . Brains of eight locusts were dissected and fixed for 4 hours at 4Â°C with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2, supple-mented with 10% sucrose . After three rinses in phosphate buffer, specimens were incubated for 4 hours at 4Â°C in a solution containing 13 mM acetylthiocholine iodide, 0.2 mM ethopropazine hydrochloride, 18 mM copper sulphate, 33 mM glycine, and 25 mM sodium succinate, pH 5.3 modified from Lewis and Shute, 1969 . After rinsing in 25 mM sodium succinate buffer, pH 5.6, incubation for 10 minutes at 4Â°C in a 1% sodium sulphide solution in 25 mM sodium succinate buffer at pH 5.6 led to the formation of copper sulphide Butcher, 1983 , an electron-dense reac-tion product. Specimens were post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated, and embedded in Araldite resin. Horizontal semithin and thin sections were taken of different regions. Semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue, whereas thin sections were stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate for examination under the electron micro-scope. A further eight locusts were used for control experi-ments. Extracellular staining was eliminated when the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide was omitted in the preparation of the staining solution, preventing the initial enzyme reaction from taking place. Enzyme activity was also eliminated by the addition of 1 mM of the cholinester-ase blocker eserine to the incubation medium. The micrographs were scanned at 600 DPI. They were labelled in Adobe Photoshop, contrast and brightness were adjusted, and the figures were printed with an Alps MD 1300 dye-sublimation printer. DISCUSSION Staining for acetylcholine in the ocellar tracts Each of the methods we used suggest that locust L-neurons may use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. The first method, the immunocytochemical stain for the conju-gated form of cleaved acetylcholine, is fairly direct but suffers the disadvantage that optical resolution is limited by the thickness of the sections. In the second method, acetylcholine is not detected directly, but through the expression pattern of the enzyme that synthesises it before storage in synaptic vesicles.Although ChAT is a character-istic component of all cholinergic neurons Hahn et al., 1992 Salvaterra and Vaughn, 1989 , the immunocyto-chemical method relies on the antiserum being specific for the enzyme in the particular species examined. The poly-clonal anti-ChAT antiserum by Chemicon appears to be a broad band marker for ChAT for evolutionary distant species, since, apart from several mammal species, it has been found to stain spider ChAT Fabian and Seyfarth, 1997 , and our Western blot showed that the antiserum is selective for a distinct band of between 50 and 90 kDa. Purification of locust ChAT resulted in a band at 65 kDa Lutz et al., 1988 , and similar values have been found for Drosophila ChAT, although the active form of Drosophila ChAT is believed to be 81 kDa Takagawa and Salvaterra, 1996 . Our molecular markers do not allow an exact detection of the molecular weight, but nevertheless the blot points toward a specific reaction of the antiserum in the locust, whereas the monoclonal antiserum against Drosophila ChAT appears to react with a protein of lower molecular weight. Expression pattern of ChAT largely corresponds to the pattern of staining for conjugated choline. Within the protocerebrum, most cell bodies did not strongly stain for conjugated choline, with a few cell bodies in the pars intercerebralis staining intensely, as described previously by Geffard et al. 1985a , who produced the antibody. Lutz and Tyrer 1987 , who stained for ChAT, found strongly staining cell bodies in a similar position in the locust protocerebrum, but whereas their antiserum mainly seemed to bind to cell bodies in this regions, the Chemicon polyclonal ChAT antiserum mainly stained neuropilar regions. The staining that we found for both conjugated choline and ChAT in the antennal lobe is consistent with the well-established cholinergic nature of antennal sen-sory neurons in Lepidoptera Stengl et al., 1990 Homberg et al., 1995 . In the ocellar tracts, all the axons over 10 Î¼m in diameter stained for conjugated choline, suggesting that the axons of all classes of L-neuron contained acetylcho-line. ChAT staining resulted in a consistent staining pattern, but staining in the tracts appeared to differ along the course of the axons, with distinct staining of large-diameter axons near the origin of the ocellar tracts, but more diffuse staining of the ocellar tracts in their middle region. Nevertheless, near the arbour of L1âL3, axons were again distinctly stained. On some sections, the periphery of an L-neuron axon stained more intensely with anti-choline than the centre. This might be because synaptic vesicles tend to accumu-late toward the periphery, although L4 and L5 in the lateral tracts have not been found to make output syn-apses from their axons Simmons and Littlewood, 1989 Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . Another explanation for this pattern of staining might be that the marker used tends to accumulate on cell membranes as reported from electron micrographs by Sun et al., 1993 . In some cases, the staining around the edges of L-neurons might be localised in surrounding, smaller neuronal profiles, which cannot be distinguished from L-neurons in the 50-Î¼m-thick sections. The third staining technique we used detected acetylcho-linesterase, an enzyme that inactivates acetylcholine after it has been secreted into the synaptic cleft.Although this is necessary evidence, it is not sufficient because acetylcholin-esterase co-localises so many other transmitter systems. Insect acetylcholinesterase is mostly a membrane-bound ectoenzyme Toutant, 1989 , and histochemical demonstra-tion of acetylcholinesterase activity has been used previ-ously as a marker for cholinergic synaptic sites e.g., Smith and Treherne, 1965 Kral and Schneider, 1981 Rind and Simmons, 1998 . However, caution is needed in interpret-ing the significance of the presence of acetylcholinesterase because this enzyme has been found to be present in some tissues devoid of cholinergic innervation Toutant, 1989 . In vertebrates, alternative functions suggested for acetyl-cholinesterase include neuromodulation and proteolysis Greenfield, 1984 Appleyard, 1992 . In the insect nervous system, a role for acetylcholinesterase in development is indicated by its transient appearance at certain develop-mental stages in Drosophila photoreceptors Wolfgang and Forte, 1989 . The association we found between the locations of synapses and of extracellular precipitate provides good evidence both that L-neurons release acetylcholine and for a role for acetylcholinesterase in the normal function of their output synapses. We found positive staining for the enzyme in all three ocellar tracts, mostly toward the axis of the tract, where some L-neuron axons make excitatory outputs with third-order Simmons and Littlewood, 1989 or other L-neurons Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . Extra-cellular staining was also found at synapses of L-neurons located in the protocerebral arbours of L1â3, where these neurons inhibit each other Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . Extracellular staining was not found along regions of L-neuron membrane where synapses are absent. We did, however, find that some glial cells and some cell bodies stain for acetylcholinesterase, as has been reported before in the terminal abdominal ganglion of the cockroach Smith and Treherne, 1965 . In locust thoracic ganglia, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors occur on glial cells and cell bodies of neurons Leitch et al., 1993 . Little is known about the neurotransmitters of ocellar L-neurons in other insect species. In Drosophila, ocellar L-neurons stain with antibodies raised against ChAT Yasuyama et al., 1995 . In honeybees, on the other hand, glutamate immunoreactivity has been found in ocellar L-neurons Bicker et al., 1988 . In locusts, we found in electron microscopic experiments that glutamate immuno-reactivity was not stronger in axons of L-neurons than in their surrounding methods after Hardt and Watson, 1999 . It is quite possible that the largest second-order ocellar interneurons in different species use different neurotransmitters. There are considerable differences in structure and function of these neurons between locusts, bees Pan and Goodman, 1977 Guy et al., 1979 , and flies Simmons et al., 1994 . Functions of acetylcholine Given that we found staining for acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase in regions where both excitatory and inhibitory synapses occur, we suggest that both types of synapse use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. There are good examples from at least two different groups of animal in which identified cholinergic neurons inhibit some postsynaptic targets and excite others. A number of examples of multifunctional neurons are known in the gastropod Aplysia, including neuron L10 in the abdominal ganglion, which contains ChAT Giller and Schwartz, 1968, 1971 . Direct application of acetylcholine to postsyn-aptic targets of L10 exactly mimics the ionic conductances that are caused in postsynaptic neurons when L10 is excited electrically Blankenship et al., 1971 , and both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses are blocked by the same antagonists Kandel et al., 1967 . In the stomatogastric ganglion of the crustacean Panuli-rus, some motoneurons that use acetylcholine as a neuro-transmitter excite muscle fibres but make inhibitory con- nections with other neurons Marder, 1976 Bidaut, 1980 Eisen and Marder, 1984 . In insects, acetylcholine is well established as a neuro-transmitter of sensory neurons. These include the filiform sensilla in the cercal system of cockroaches Callec et al., 1971 for a review, see Sattelle and Breer, 1990 , olfactory sensilla of adult moths Waldrop and Hildebrand, 1989 Stengl et al., 1990 , and tactile hairs in caterpillars Trimmer and Weeks, 1989 . In the locust thorax, ChAT has been extracted from sensory cell bodies Emson et al., 1974 , and many mechanosensory neurons are immunore-active for this enzyme Lutz and Tyrer, 1988 . Acetylcholine is also likely to be a major transmitter in the optic lobes of insects Hardie, 1989 . Cholinesterase activity was detected in optic lobe tissue in crickets and Drosophila Lee et al., 1973 Greenspan et al., 1980 , and staining for ChAT can be found in all three optic neuropils, in apparently columnar as well as in tangential elements Buchner et al., 1986 Gorczyca and Hall, 1987 Datum et al., 1989 . Nevertheless, the interpretation as to which specific neurons in the optic lobe of the fly are cholinergic is controversial for reviews, see Hardie, 1989 Homberg, 1994 , and staining for ChAT in the lamina has been attributed to amacrine cells Datum et al., 1989 , to centrifugal elements Buchner et al., 1986 , or to second-order neurons Gorczyca and Hall, 1987 Ikeda and Salva-terra, 1989 . In the locust optic lobe, dense staining for acetylcholinesterase occurs extracellularly around the syn-aptic terminals of medullary neurons with the lobula giant motion detector Rind and Simmons, 1998 , and it has been proposed that the transmitter released by the medul-lary neurons causes both excitation and inhibition in the motion-detecting circuit. There is evidence for the involvement of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in pathways involving choliner-gic mechanoreceptors in two different insects, moth cater-pillars Trimmer and Weeks, 1989, 1993 and locusts Parker and Newland, 1995 . In caterpillars, tactile hairs on the prolegs make excitatory connections with proleg retractor motor neurons, and in locusts, campaniform sensilla on the hind leg excites the fast extensor tibiae motor neuron. There is evidence that nicotinic receptors mediate fast, brief responses, whereas muscarinic recep-tors mediate slower, more prolonged responses including lateral and self-inhibition Trimmer, 1995 . Most actions of acetylcholine on insect neurons that have been described are excitatory. There is only one report of a hyperpolarising potential being evoked by acetylcholine in insects, from cell bodies of dorsal unpaired neurons of cockroach abdominal ganglia maintained in vitro Lapied et al., 1992 . The excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at output synapses from L-neurons 1â3 are caused by in-creases in conductance that rise and then fall within a few milliseconds Simmons, 1982b, 1985 , suggesting that they are mediated by receptors coupled directly to ionic chan-nels, such as nicotinic receptors. They do, however, have longer latencies than synapses that have been described in the thoracic ganglion for example, at 30Â°C, L-neuron output synapses have a latency of 1.5 ms Simmons, 1990 compared with 0.7 ms for a synapse between two thoracic motor neurons Burrows, 1989 . This difference in latency might be due to differences between presynaptic elements, such as calcium channels that regulate transmitter re-lease, rather than to the type of postsynaptic receptor. So far, ocellar L-neurons are the only examples described in insects that cause both excitatory and inhibitory postsyn-aptic potentials. In the thoracic ganglia, where many pathways involving local spiking and non-spiking neurons have been identified Burrows, 1996 , change in synaptic polarity has always been found to involve polysynaptic connections. We suggest that acetylcholine, released by ocellar L-neurons, can evoke fast excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in different postsynaptic neurons. RESULTS Structure of the ocellar tracts Locusts possess three ocelli, each of which is connected with the brain by a nerve that continues as a coherent tract containing the 10â30-Î¼m-wide axons of L-neurons and a number of smaller axons Goodman, 1974 . Each lateral tract runs from the ocellar nerve toward the midline of the brain, within 100 Î¼m of the dorsal surface, and then bends to run posteriorly all directions are relative to the animalâs neuraxis . The axons of neurons L1â3 start to branch and form arbours about 300 Î¼m posterior to this bend, which the axons of L4â5 travel past before forming their own arbour Fig. 1A . The median ocellar tract runs from the ventral to the dorsal surface of the brain and includes four ML-neurons, two of which join each lateral ocellar tract, and two M1 L-neurons that make terminal arbours overlapping those of number L1â3 Goodman, 1974 . In horizontal sections through the proto-cerebrum perpendicular to the neuraxis just posterior to the bend in the lateral ocellar tracts, profiles of up to seven L-neurons can be resolved clearly Fig. 1B . The median ocellar tract, which follows a looped path through the brain, often appears in cross section on the same sections. In a tract, L-neuron axons are smooth, and L1â3 make output synapses to small processes of third-order neurons Simmons and Littlewood, 1989 and to small processes of L4â5 Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . Sections that pass through the anterior part of the terminal arbour of L1â3 show the axons of L1â3 branching to form smaller pro-cesses, and also the junction between the lateral and median ocellar tracts Fig. 1C . The three L1â3 neurons make inhibitory synapses with each other in their arbours Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . In this study, we also found output synapses from L-neuron axons in the median ocellar tract these are known to function in a similar way to those made by lateral L-neurons Simmons, 1986 . Immunocytochemical demonstration of conjugated choline The ocellar tracts can be recognised readily in 50-Î¼m-thick sections of the protocerebrum as darkly staining structures when stained with the antibody against conju-gated choline Fig. 2 . The axons of L-neurons stained consistently in all 12 brains that were incubated using dilutions of primary antibody between 1 2,000 and 1 8,000. Within each tract, the profiles of six or seven axons could usually be resolved, and staining was more intense around the periphery than in the centre of each axon profile Fig. 2A,B . At the beginning of the arbour of L1â3, smaller profiles also stained with the anti-choline antibody Fig. 2C . In this plane, stained axons of L-neurons within the median ocellar tract were also seen Fig. 2C , as they were in sections cut more anteriorly through the brain Fig. Apart from the ocellar tracts, the highest intensity of staining was seen in 10â20 cell bodies, 10 Î¼m across, and in at least two larger cell bodies, 15â20 Î¼m across in the pars intercerebralis of the protocerebrum Fig. 2E . Cell bodies in the pars intercerebralis have previously been reported to stain with this antibody Geffard et al., 1985a . We also found staining for conjugated choline in the upper division of the central body Fig. 2C and in the antennal lobes, which are known to receive innervation from cholin-ergic sensory neurons in moths Homberg et al., 1995 . Immunocytochemical demonstration of choline acetyltransferase Western blot. After separating proteins by electropho-resis and immunoblotting, staining with the polyclonal ChAT antiserum revealed that one band of between 50 and 94 kDa showed by far the strongest reaction Fig. 3A . This corresponds to the molecular weight of locust ChAT, which has been found to be 65 kDa in purified samples Lutz et al., 1988 , and this antiserum was therefore used for immunohistochemistry. On the other hand, staining with the monoclonal antiserum against Drosophila ChAT showed high affinity to one band that did not have an appropriate molecular weight slightly above. 30 kDa Fig. 3A , and the antiserum was therefore not used for immuno-cytochemistry. The immunocytochemical detection of ChAT showed that the enzyme is expressed in the axons of ocellar L-neurons. The lateral ocellar tracts could be identified in seven of nine animals, and in these, axons of large diameter stained for ChAT Fig. 3B,C . Not all parts of the axons or their arbour were equally strongly stained, with distinct stain-ing of the axons in the most anterior part of the lateral ocellar tracts. In contrast, near the central body Fig. 3C , staining was present in the ocellar tracts, but it was much more diffuse. Distinct staining of the large-diameter axons was detected again near the arbour of L1â3, where axons from the median ocellar tract, joining the two lateral tracts, also exhibited staining Fig. 3D . In general, neuro-pilar regions were more strongly stained for ChAT than cell bodies, and ChAT immunoreactivity was also found in the central body Fig. 3C , in parts of the mushroom bodies Fig. 3C , and in the antennal lobes. In the central body, staining for ChAT Fig. 3C appeared to be stronger than staining for conjugated choline, but both showed a similar columnar pattern compare Fig. 3C with Fig. 2E . Histochemical demonstration of acetylcholinesterase Dark precipitate, indicating the presence of acetylcholin-esterase, was found outside neuronal profiles in the ocellar tracts in both light Fig. 4A and electron Fig. 4B micrographs. Although the outer region of the lateral tracts was unstained, a dark extracellular precipitate was found against parts of the axons of L-neurons toward the core of the tracts, which is where smaller neuronal profiles are also situated, and where L1â3 make synapses to third-order neurons Simmons and Littlewood, 1989 and to L4 and L5 Littlewood and Simmons, 1992 . A densely staining precipitate was also found surrounding some of the smaller neuronal profiles Fig. 4B and was associated with glial cells and neuronal somata in the pars intercere-bralis. Closer examination of L-neuron axons showed that the extracellular precipitate was associated with synapses, indicated by the presence of vesicles clustered around presynaptic densities within an axon Fig. 4C,D . Areas of L-neuron axons where synapses were lacking were also devoid of extracellular staining Fig. 4B,C . Extracellular precipitates along the membranes of L-neurons were also associated with synapses made by L1â3 in their terminal arbours. Here, we could follow branches stemming from larger L-neuron profiles Fig. 4E . The median ocellar tract showed the same pattern as the lateral ocellar tracts, with darkly staining extracellular precipitate associated with synapses made between the axons of L-neurons and smaller neuronal profiles Fig. 4F . The extracellular precipitate was absent in control sections in which acetylthiocholine iodide had been omit-ted Fig. 5A,B , or in which the esterase blocker eserine had been added Fig. 5C . Apart from the absence of extracellular precipitate, neuronal and synaptic structure appeared quite normal in these control sections. As a positive control, we sectioned the antennal lobes because, in moths, this region is known to receive input from cholinergic neurons, as reported by Homberg et al. 1995 . Like these authors, we found a densely staining, extracel-lular and intracellular precipitate in the antennal lobes. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Mark W.

Comp.

The retinas of adult teleost fish, because they grow throughout life and can regenerate following an injury, provide an especially attractive model system for such investigations. In an effort to provide a quantitative foundation for testing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of pattern formation during growth and regeneration of the vertebrate retina, nearest neighbor and auto-correlation analyses were used to examine the mosaic patterns of eight inner retinal cell groups in the native and regenerated retina of adult zebrafish. In both native and regenerated retina, the mosaic patterns of most inner retinal cells are non-random. However, regenerated mosaics tend toward significantly lower nearest neighbor distances, less orderly patterns, and more variable radial locations than their native retina counterparts. The individual cell groups in both native and regenerated inner retina are likely to be spatially distributed independently. The results support the hypotheses that, in the adult zebrafish: 1) distinct inner retinal cell groups of native retina are also present in regenerated retina; 2) the assembly of inner retinal cell mosaics is controlled by non-random spatial organizing mechanisms during development, growth, and regeneration; and 3) the spatial organization of cell mosaics is disrupted during regeneration. The results suggest that retinal regeneration may represent a spatially disrupted recapitulation of retinal developmental mechanisms.</AbstractText></Citation></Article>

The purpose of the present study was to determine the development of the projection from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus DNLL to the IC in rat prior to the onset of hearing postnatal day 12 13 . Lipophilic carbocyanine dye, DiI 1,18-dioctodecyl-3,3,38,38-tetramethylindocarbo-cyanine perchlorate , was used to trace the crossed inhibitory projection of DNLL in a developmental series of rat embryos and pups between ages embryonic day 15 E15 and postnatal day 12 P12 . Dye-coated pins were positioned in paraformaldehyde-fixed brains either unilaterally in DNLL embryonic cases , or in the commissure of Probst where DNLL fibers cross the midline postnatal cases . By E15, pioneer fibers have left DNLL and crossed the midline.Afew fibers have nearly reached the contralateral IC by E19.At birth E22 5 P0 , the projection has invaded ventromedial, high-frequency layers of the IC. The vast majority of DNLL axons parallel the presumptive IC layers by P4, and by P8 the projection has segregated into a pattern of bands afferent dense and interband afferent sparse spaces that encompasses the entire frequency axis of the IC. Adult-like patches, regions along afferent bands that exhibit the heaviest labeling, develop by P12. These results indicate that some mature projection patterns are in place prior to the onset of hearing. Such findings suggest that evoked activity may not be required for the initial organization of patterned projections in the ascending auditory pathway. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 368-382, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Multiple ascending auditory pathways converge in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus IC , including projections from various cell types in the cochlear nuclei, superior olivary complex, and nuclei of the lateral lemnis-cus rat Beyerl, 1978 cat Adams, 1979 Brunso-Bechtold et al., 1981 mustache bat Zook and Casseday, 1982 opossum Willard and Martin, 1983 ferret Moore, 1988 mole Kudo et al., 1990 . In addition, descending cortical projections and commissural projections from the contra-lateral inferior colliculus end in the central nucleus of the IC Druga and Syka, 1984 Coleman and Clerici, 1987 Saldan Ëa and Mercha Â´n, 1992 Saldan Ëa et al., 1996 . All of these afferent projections are highly ordered in relation to the distinct fibrodendritic layers that comprise the IC. Fibrodendritic layers are composed of parallel sheets of cells that exhibit flat dendritic arbors and associated afferent fibers Oliver and Morest, 1984 Faye-Lund and Osen, 1985 Oliver et al., 1991 Malmierca et al., 1993 . This organization preserves the frequency order of the cochlea, with high frequencies being represented in the ventromedial part of the central nucleus and low frequen-cies in more dorsolateral regions Clopton and Winfield, 1973 Merzenich and Reid, 1974 Huang and Fex 1986 Ryan et al., 1988 Kelly et al., 1998 . Not all afferent projections end uniformly within all layers or even in a single layer, however, resulting in heterogeneous synaptic compartments Roth et al., 1978 . Patterns of bands and patches have been described for several projections from binaural nuclei such as the lateral superior olive Shneider-man and Henkel, 1987 Oliver et al., 1997 and dorsal nuclei of the lateral lemniscus Kudo, 1981 Shneiderman et al., 1988 Bajo et. al., 1993 , as well as from monaural nuclei such as the cochlear nucleus Oliver, 1987 Oliver et al., 1997 . Banded projections form complementary patterns in the IC and bear a striking resemblance to the organization of ocular dominance columns in the visual system LeVay et al., 1975 Hubel et al., 1976, 1977 Rakic, 1976 LeVay et al., 1980 . The crossed and uncrossed bands of termination from the lateral superior olive have been shown to interdigi-tate Shneiderman and Henkel, 1987 and a similar rela-tion is likely to exist for bands of crossed and uncrossed projections from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemnis-cus Kudo, 1981 Shneiderman et al., 1988 . Within a single layer, portions of bands or patches that share the same array of converging inputs may be further subdi-vided into functional compartments. Integration within and between such compartments within the central nucleus of the IC may process sound features other than frequency. Whether projection patterns within the IC are established by mechanisms similar to those that determine ocular dominance columns has not been investigated. The banded projections from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus DNLL are among the shortest extrinsic afferents to the IC. The DNLL projects bilaterally to the IC Adams, 1979 Beyerl, 1978 Brunso-Bechtold et al., 1981 Coleman and Clerici, 1987 Shneiderman et al., 1988 Shneiderman and Oliver, 1989 Hutson et al., 1991 Bajo et al., 1993, Mercha Â´n et al., 1994 and its contralateral fibers cross the brainstem ventral to the aqueduct, where they are isolated from other afferents. Situated just ventral to the inferior colliculus, the DNLL is composed of large, GABAergic neurons Adams and Mugnaini, 1984 Thomp-son et al., 1985 Roberts and Ribak, 1987 Glendenning and Baker, 1988 intercalated among the ascending fibers of the lateral lemniscus. There is a rough tonotopic order in the DNLL with higher frequencies represented in the ventral part of the nucleus and lower frequencies in the dorsal part Tanaka et al., 1985 Mercha Â´n et al., 1994 Bajo et al., 1999 Saint-Marie et al., 1999 . The DNLL receives the majority of its input from the superior olivary complex and the contralateral cochlear nucleus Adams and Warr, 1976 Elverland, 1978 Glendenning et al., 1981 Henkel and Spangler, 1983 . Additional inputs include connec-tions from the contralateral DNLL via the commissure of Probst Kudo, 1981 Bajo et al., 1993 Mercha Â´n et al., 1994 and a descending projection from the ipsilateral IC Ca-icedo and Herbert, 1993 . The most common cell type in the DNLL EI cells is excited by the contralateral ear and inhibited by the ipsilateral ear Aitkin et al., 1970 Marko-vitz and Pollak, 1993, 1994 . These EI neurons exert a strong inhibitory influence on cells residing in their target layers of the IC Shneiderman et al., 1993 . Since patterns of afferent connections may determine the types of processing that occur within fibrodendritic layers, it is important to understand how these patterns are established. Altman and Bayer 1981 reported that cells in the inferior colliculus are generated in the rat between embryonic day 14 E14 and the perinatal period. Different projections arrive in the IC at different times and presumably compete for synaptic space. Kandler and Friauf 1993 examined the projection from the cochlear nucleus to the rat inferior colliculus. They described a temporal sequence of events including fiber outgrowth from the cochlear nucleus initiated by E15 , axonal ar-rival in the contralateral IC by E17, and collateral branch-ing within the IC as early as E18. Kudo et al. 1996 demonstrated that projection neurons in the lateral supe-rior olive that make connections in the contralateral IC are generated on E12 13, prior to the functionally related but distinct population of uncrossed projection neurons in the lateral superior olive of the rat E14â16 . Other studies Okoyama et al., 1995 indicate that the laterality of projections from the medial superior olivary nucleus to the IC is established in the rat by birth. None of these previous studies have addressed the development of afferent patterns within the layered archi-tecture of the IC, which is critical for formation of integra-tive circuits. It is not known whether mature patterns of bands and patches Fig. 1AâC form initially, when fibers grow into the layers, or secondarily, from an initial over-lap. Thus, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the development of a single afferent projection to the IC. In this paper we describe the development of the crossed projection from the DNLL to the IC in pre-and post-natal rats using carbocyanine dyes as axonal tracers in fixed tissue. The results indicate that the pattern of bands and patches develop secondarily from an initially diffuse projec-tion distribution, and suggest that both progressive and regressive mechanisms are likely to contribute to the formation of these patterns prior to onset of hearing. Preliminary findings have been reported Gabriele and Henkel, 1999 . MATERIALS AND METHODS All procedures were approved by the institutionâs Ani-mal Care and Use Committee and conform to NIH stan-dards. Embryonic experiments fixation, tracer placement, and sectioning Results from 12 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos were used in the present study Table 1 . Timed-pregnant females embryonic stages E15 and E19 were given an overdose of ketamine 100 mg kg and xylazine 12 mg kg . After opening the abdomen, the uterus was exposed and the embryos were harvested one at a time. Each embryo was immediately perfused through the heart using a syringe filled with 4% paraformaldehyde fixative pH 7.4 . The brains were removed from the skull and placed back into the fixative for 24â48 hours. Each brain was blocked in the coronal plane and embedded in an egg yolk gelatin mix-ture 5 ml 8% gelatin in dH2O 10 ml egg yolk . Transverse sections 50 Î¼m were cut on a vibratome proceeding from rostral-to-caudal through the block of tissue in order to determine the rostral border of the DNLL. After identify-ing the nucleus, crystals of lipophilic dye, DiI 1,18-dioctodecyl-3,3,38,38-tetramethylindocarbocyanine per-chlorate Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR , were positioned unilaterally in the left DNLL Fig. 2A . This fluorescent molecule becomes incorporated in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and spreads both anterogradely and retro-gradely via passive diffusion. Following DiI placement, the tissue was placed into fresh 4% paraformaldehyde fixative. To facilitate diffusion of the tracer in the fixed tissue, the block was incubated at 37Â°C and stored in the dark for 1 month. Sections were then cut 75 Î¼m , mounted onto charged slides, and coverslipped while still wet with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . Immediately following data collection, the temporary coverslips were removed and the case was remounted onto gelatin-subbed slides for Nissl-staining. Slides were then permanently coverslipped with Cytoseal Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ . Postnatal experiments fixation, tracer placement, and sectioning Data compiled from 27 postnatal rats were included in the results of this study refer to Table 1 . Tracing experi-ments were performed in neonates prior to postnatal day 0 5 P0, P4, and P8 and concurrent with P12 physiologi-cal onset of hearing Jewett and Romano, 1972 Puel and Uziel, 1987 . Postnatal day 12 was the latest time point examined since it marked the end of the developmental period of interest the period prior to evoked experience . In addition, we found that while DiI worked well in fixed rat tissue up to P12, as early as P20 visualization and diffusion of the dye were greatly reduced, presumably due to the increase in myelination of fibers. At each age, animals were given an overdose of ketamine 100 mg kg and xylazine 12 mg kg and perfused through the heart with a 4% paraformaldehyde fixative. The brains were subsequently removed from the skull and embedded as described above. A cut-down procedure similar to that explained for the embryonic cases was performed until the rostral boundary of the commissure of Probst was identi-fied. The commissure was completely severed in the remain-ing block of tissue, and glass pins coated with DiI were positioned in the midline where the crossing DNLL fibers had been disrupted Fig. 2B . The tissue block was moved back into fixative and stored in the dark at 37Â°C for approximately 2â3 months. After the incubation, the tis-sue was sectioned and mounted as described for the embryonic experiments. Data collection, analysis, and technical considerations for developmental studies Sections were viewed with an epifluorescent microscope Nikon equipped with a rhodamine filter set ChromaTech-nology, Brattleboro, VT . Owing to the unstable nature of the fluorescent dye after sectioning, data collection was performed immediately and was completed within 48 hours. For the embryonic cases unilateral DNLL injec-tions , observations concerning outgrowth, trajectory, and relative distance traveled by contralaterally projecting DNLL fibers were made. Tracer in these cases was not placed at the midline as in the postnatal cases for the obvious reason that DNLL fibers may not yet have reached the midline. Development of the ipsilateral projection from the DNLL was not assessed due to considerable uptake of the tracer by lemniscal fibers of passage as evidenced by retrogradely-labeled cells in the contralateral lateral supe-rior olive and contralateral cochlear nucleus of E19 rat embryos. Images of all sections containing the DNLL and IC were video-captured and digitized using the public domain NIH Image program developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at http rsb.in-fo.nih.gov nih-image . In order to qualitatively assess developmental changes in the projection, 35 mm photo-graphs of a section at a standardized level in the caudal portion of the rostral 1 3 of the central nucleus where banding was most evident at the older ages were taken for each of the postnatal cases. A section of the DNLL at the midpoint along the rostrocaudal axis also was photo-graphed for each case in order to compare the relative positions of retrogradely-filled cells at the various develop-mental stages 35 mm negatives were digitized using an AGFA DuoScan Brockton, MA . Scanned images were then cropped in Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA and only the brightness and contrast were modified. Line drawings of the photographed sections were traced directly from the optical image in the microscope by using Neurolucida software Microbrightfield, Colchester, VT . Quantitative measurements were made, calculating the extent of DNLL fiber ingrowth in the IC % distance along IC layers at each of the postnatal ages. In addition, portions of labeled DNLL axons located within the central nucleus of the IC and identifiable as single arbors were reconstructed for P0, P4, and P8 cases. Given the density of the projection at P12, portions of single axons could not be reconstructed without being heavily biased toward regions of sparse labeling unpatched and unbanded ar-eas . Thus, measurements calculating the mean number of branch points per unit length of axon, in order to quantify developmental changes in arbor complexity, were made only for P0, P4, and P8 cases. No attempt was made at P4 and P8 to distinguish between arbors sampled within presumptive banded regions and those located in surround-ing territories. The cut-down procedure described for the commissural postnatal injections was developed for two reasons. First, the technique provides a reproducible and extremely accu-rate means of labeling the projection of interest 27 out of the total 36 postnatal cases [75%] were successful and included in the results . Second, this approach results in bilateral IC labeling consisting exclusively of the contralat-eral DNLLprojection. Despite gross severing of the commis-sure to ensure a complete labeling of the projection, no retrogradely-labeled cells were found in any other auditory nuclei. Such results provided confidence that the projec-tion pattern described was that solely from the contralat-eral DNLL. The DiI commissural placements invariably resulted in bilaterally equivalent labeling. For each indi-vidual case the afferent distribution within the central nucleus of the IC and the retrograde labeling of the DNLL on one side always closely resembled that observed on the opposite side, both in pattern and relative density. Such reliable bilateral comparisons of a single projection within the IC might serve as a model system for future studies assessing the mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of banded projections. Adult cases While previous work reported connections between the DNLL and IC in the adult rat Bajo et al., 1993 , the termination pattern of DNLL fibers within IC layers was not emphasized. Therefore, to facilitate comparisons be-tween our developmental results and the mature projec-tion pattern, we made in vivo injections in the commissure of Probst in two adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were deeply anesthetized with an initial surgical dose of ket-amine 80 mg kg and xylazine 12 mg kg and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Supplementary doses of ketamine were administered as needed throughout the duration of the procedure. Stereotaxic coordinates for the injection site in the midline commissure were determined Paxinos and Watson, 1986 . A craniotomy was made unilaterally and a micropipet diameter of 10â20 Î¼m filled with 5% mini-ruby dextran, tetramethylrhodamine and biotin 10,000MW Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR in dH2O was lowered at an angle to the commissure of Probst. The tracer was administered via iontophoretic injection 5 Î¼A positive current in alternating cycles of 10 seconds ON 10 seconds OFF for a duration of 20 minutes , the micropipet was withdrawn, and the wound was sutured. Following a 3â4 day post-operative survival time to allow for adequate transport of the tracer, the rats were given an overdose of ketamine and perfused through the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde 0.05% glutaraldehyde fixative in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brains were embedded, blocked in the coronal plane, and cut at 50 Î¼m on a vibratome. Sections were processed with avidin-biotin complex ABC, Vector, Burlingame, CA and reacted with diaminobenzidine DAB as described previously Henkel and Gabriele, 1999 . The mature afferent pattern of the crossed DNLL projection to the IC was reconstructed using Neurolucida software refer to Fig. 1 . Under high power magnification, the termination pattern of DNLL fibers within IC layers was determined by marking each axonal varicosity. This representation of the adult circuit served as a standard for describing the development of the crossed DNLL projection to the IC. DISCUSSION The results of these experiments in pre-and post-natal rats demonstrate the normal developmental sequence of an inhibitory projection to the IC prior to onset of hearing. DNLL cells are born between E12 and E14 Altman and Bayer, 1980 . Between E15 and E19 fiber outgrowth is initiated and pioneer DNLL axons destined for the contra-lateral IC have reached the border of the central nucleus. The projection within the central nucleus of the IC at birth is diffuse and fibers are linear and relatively unbranched. From P0 to P4, the distribution of the projection becomes noticeably more dense, presumably due to later arriving fibers and increased collateralization of axons within their target. During this initial postnatal period the distribution of label within the ventromedial IC is quite uniform. By P8, the projection has segregated into a pattern of afferent bands, and by P12 adult-like patches of label are evident, indicating that the basic DNLL projection pattern to the contralateral IC is in place by the onset of hearing Fig. 10 . Spatiotemporal developmental gradient There is substantial evidence that there exists a fre-quency-related gradient within developing auditory struc-tures, such that high-frequency regions of nuclei mature prior to low-frequency regions. Birth of high-frequency neurons in the IC precedes that of low-frequency neurons Altman and Bayer, 1981 . Kandler and Friauf 1993 demonstrated that high-frequency cochlear nucleus axons not only invade IC layers prior to low-frequency fibers, but they also are the first to sprout collaterals within their target. Other pivotal developmental events, including synapse formation Neises et al., 1982 Schweitzer and Cant, 1984 , synaptic transmission Jackson et al., 1982 , and even maturation of the auditory periphery Lenoir et al., 1980, 1987 , appear to obey the general rule that high-frequency areas are the first to mature. Our findings in the DNLL and IC further support a frequency-related developmental gradient. Based on the described tonotopic order of the DNLL Tanaka et al., 1985 Mercha Â´n et al., 1994 Bajo et al., 1999 Saint-Marie et al., 1999 , it can be implied from our retrograde data refer to Fig. 4C that axons of high-frequency DNLL neurons are the first to traverse the midline in the commissure of Probst. Anterograde labeling of the crossed DNLL projection via commissural DiI placement revealed a spatiotemporal gradient within the central nucleus of the IC. Axonal ingrowth P0 , banding P8 , and subse-quent patch formation P12 in ventromedial, high-frequency areas always preceded that observed in more dorsolateral, low-frequency areas. Specific low-frequency DNLL patches had not formed by P12, but likely develop shortly after hearing onset. In addition to a frequency gradient, preliminary observa-tions in the central nucleus of P12 rats suggest that there may also be a rostral-to-caudal developmental gradient within the inferior colliculus. While formation of patches was evident in the rostral third of the central nucleus of the IC at P12, caudal regions of the central nucleus exhibited banding much like that described at P8 data not shown . Axonal branching Our qualitative observations describe a continued elabo-ration of labeled axons within the target during the examined postnatal period. Measurements quantifying the number of branches per unit length of axon support these observations. Our data show increased branching of DNLL axons in the IC throughout this period, yet qualita-tive differences between projection distributions at P4 and P8 suggest that regressive events are likely involved in the establishment of bands and patches as well. Whether differences in arbor complexity exist across frequency, between afferent dense and afferent sparse regions or between preterminal and terminal field portions of indi-vidual DNLL axons, has yet to be determined. Taken together, the qualitative and quantitative find-ings imply a developmental sequence that involves a combination of progressive and regressive events. One interpretation is that elaboration of arbors contribute to the addition of connections within patches, whereas refine-ment defines patch boundaries and spaces between patches. The described development of the DNLL projection sug-gests that, as in the visual system, a layered pattern of auditory projections is already in place prior to the onset of sensory experience. Therefore, evoked activity is not re-quired for the initial formation of bands and patches. This does not imply, however, that activity of any kind is not fundamental in constructing circuits prior to maturation of the auditory periphery. In fact, experiments in the developing avian system reported synchronous waves of spontaneously generated activity as early as E14 in chick E21 5 hatching Lippe, 1994, 1995 . Similar waves of activity traverse the immature retina, propagate across multiple synapses, and are required for pattern forma-tion in the visual thalamus and cortex Galli and Maffei, 1988 Meister et al., 1991 Feller et al., 1996 review Katz and Shatz, 1996 Mooney et al., 1996 Shatz, 1996 Feller et al, 1997 Penn et al., 1998 . Temporally concerted spontaneous events may therefore provide cues that guide the spatial organization of developing auditory projec-tions. Growth of DNLL projection layers The distribution of DNLL axons in IC layers was as-sessed for each of the postnatal ages. The target of the projection continued to expand along the ventrolateral- dorsomedial axis of IC layers from birth to the onset of hearing. Subsequently, distributions became concentrated into patches in high-frequency layers. The described pro-gression along IC layers, however, did not take into account changes in the size of the central nucleus relative to the IC. Therefore, the data could be interpreted one of two ways 1 axons fill the nascent central nucleus and grow with it as it expands or 2 the central nucleus is proportionately large perinatally and fibers continually extend to fill its layers. Based on examination of our Nissl tissue, it was difficult to rule out either possibility since collicular subdivisions at P0 were not obvious. At older ages, superimposition of fluorescent images and Nissl images provided no indications that DNLL axons overex-tend the boundaries of the central nucleus and invade portions of the dorsal cortex of the IC. Comparison with development of afferent projections from the cochlear nucleus The results of the present study can be compared with previous findings in rat that described the ontogeny of the projection to the IC from the cochlear nucleus Kandler and Friauf, 1993 . Although these afferent inputs share the same target the central nucleus of IC , the cochlear nucleus projection is excitatory, while that arising from the DNLL is inhibitory. It is therefore of interest to consider whether these inherently different projections that origi-nate from distinct levels of the system develop concur-rently or independent of each other. Much like Kandler and Friauf described for the cochlear nucleus, the development of the crossed DNLL projection can be divided into several periods. The first period, characterized by fiber outgrowth and commissural cross-ing, is initiated at approximately the same embryonic stage E15 for the two pathways. During subsequent periods characterized by axonal growth into target, collat-eralization in target, etc. , however, the developmental progression of the DNLL projection appears to lag behind 2â4 days that of the cochlear nucleus. While axons from the cochlear nucleus reach the contralateral IC as early as E17, pioneer DNLL fibers do not arrive until E19. Simi-larly, collateral branching within IC layers is initiated as early as E18 for the cochlear nucleus projection, while branching of DNLL axons within the contralateral IC is first observed at birth E22 5 P0 . Despite these differ-ences in timing, the two projections seem to obey the same rules once in the target. Both inputs experience a develop-mental gradient within the IC such that rostral, high-frequency areas mature first followed by more caudal, low-frequency areas. Whether the process and timing of band and subsequent patch formation is universal for all patterned inputs to the IC remains to be seen. Projection development in the absence of auditory experience The DNLL not only has been shown to be functionally important in shaping discharge patterns of IC cells Kelly and Li, 1997 van Adel et al., 1999 but also has been implicated as having a profound influence on certain integrative tasks performed at the level of the auditory midbrain, including processing of multiple sound events for review see Pollak, 1997 Litovsky and Yin, 1998 . It is therefore intriguing that such a highly organized and functionally important binaural circuit develops largely before auditory experience. The initial, diffuse arrangement of DNLL fibers, fol-lowed by segregation into afferent bands and patches in IC as described in this study, suggests that competitive interactions and or transient expression of developmental factors may be influential in the establishment of specific projection domains. Preliminary observations in our labo-ratory suggest that the crossed projection from the DNLL may interdigitate with the uncrossed projection, much in same way that the crossed and uncrossed inputs from the lateral superior olive form complementary patterns within the central nucleus of the IC Shneiderman and Henkel, 1987 . In addition, there is mounting evidence of a nucleo-topic order of afferents within the central nucleus. Termi-nal fields of DNLL, lateral superior olive, and dorsal cochlear nucleus projections within the central nucleus of the IC are to a large degree spatially segregated from one another. It is possible that bands are formed first based on laterality of inputs, whereas establishment of patches and patch location is secondary and dependent upon origin of inputs. Segregation of inputs based on source, however, is by no means exclusive, as evidenced by domains that receive overlapping inputs Oliver et al., 1997 . Such an elaborate pattern of overlapping and non-overlapping affer-ent domains provides the substrate for a mosaic of func-tional compartments within the central nucleus of the IC. A variety of environmental factors e.g., competitive inter-actions, neurotrophic factors, extracellular matrix mol-ecules potentially could influence the compartmentaliza-tion of the IC. Mechanisms underlying the emergence of order within the auditory midbrain are not yet known. Future experiments are planned to assess the role of competitive interactions in both the formation spontane-ous activity levels and maintenance evoked activity levels of patterned inputs. RESULTS Embryonic development of the crossed DNLL projection Embryonic day 15 E15 E15 was the earliest devel-opmental stage studied. In 6 of the 13 cases large, unilat-eral DiI application included the nascent DNLL. In each of these cases numerous labeled fibers were observed emanat-ing from the application site. The trajectory of labeled fibers included those coursing dorsally toward ipsilateral IC neuroepithelium as well as a substantial number of fibers coursing medially and traversing the midline Fig. 3A . After examining Nissl stains of the pertinent sections, the axons destined for the contralateral side could be classified as belonging to 1 the developing projection to the contralateral DNLL, 2 the projection from the DNLL destined for the contralateral IC, or likely 3 a combination of the two developing projections. The majority of these contralaterally projecting fibers, when observed at higher magnification, lacked collaterals and exhibited presump-tive growth cones on their leading ends Fig. 3B arrow-heads . No retrogradely-labeled cells were apparent at this age in the contralateral DNLL. The results from this embryonic time point indicate that axonal outgrowth from the DNLL has certainly begun by E15. Embryonic day 19 E19 At this age, DiI application unilaterally in the DNLL resulted in clear labeling of DNLL cells on the opposite side. Retrogradely-labeled cells were evident Fig. 3C , suggesting that at least a portion of the projection connect-ing the DNLLs via the commissure of Probst is in place by E19. In addition, pioneer fibers exhibiting typical growth cones Fig. 3D arrowhead had extended to the ventral border of the contralateral IC Fig. 3C,D . Several of these fibers made a 90Â° dorsal turn toward the contralateral IC after crossing the midline Fig. 3E . Such fibers showed no indication of being collaterals of retrogradely-filled, bilater-ally projecting DNLL cells. While groups of bilaterally projecting DNLL cells could not be ruled out, we found no evidence suggesting major contributions from such a popu-lation. Postnatal development of the crossed DNLL projection Postnatal day 0 P0 5 E22 in rat . By birth, axons from the DNLL have entered the contralateral central nucleus of the IC. Initially, the distribution of fibers labeled via commissural placement of DiI was diffuse, with few axons paralleling the presumptive layers of the IC approximately 45Â°, ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial in coro-nal section . The distribution of labeled afferent fibers in all six P0 cases was confined to ventromedial, high-frequency regions of the central nucleus of the IC Fig. 4A,B . Corresponding to this distribution, retrogradely-filled cells in both DNLL appeared to be restricted to ventral and peripheral, high-frequency regions of the nucleus Fig. 4C . The vast majority of afferent fibers at this age were linear, and exhibited very few branch points Fig. 4DâF . When branches were evident they were short, perhaps indicative of early stages of collateralization of the projection within its target. Presumptive growth cones were still apparent on many of the invading fibers Fig. 4D,E arrowheads . Postnatal day 4 P4 . By P4 the projection from the contralateral DNLL was noticeably more dense, presum- ably due to a combination of ingrowth of later arriving fibers and increased branching of axons in their target. Early indications of a banded pattern were apparent Fig. 5A,B arrowheads . While the distribution of axons encom-passed more of the tonotopic axis than that observed at P0, the dorsolateral, lowest frequency region of the central nucleus was still devoid of afferents. Similarly, retrogradely-labeled cells filled more of the DNLL, but the low-frequency, core regions of the nucleus still contained fewer labeled cells Fig. 5C . Axons at this age exhibited more frequent branching Fig. 5D,E . The majority of parent fibers exhibited a trajectory parallel to presumptive IC layers Fig. 5F .Axonal branches were oriented perpendicu-lar to the parent fiber. served at P4 became more discontinuous by this age. Dense labeled fibers segregated into a pattern of afferent bands and interband spaces Fig. 6A,B paired arrow-heads . Thus, the first indication of adult-like layered organization occurred at least four days prior to onset of hearing P12 13 . The distribution of label within the central nucleus was no longer confined to ventromedial high-frequency regions, although evidence of banding in dorsolateral low-frequency parts of the central nucleus was considerably less obvious. Similarly, labeled cells in the DNLL, while still most concentrated in ventral, shell regions, could be found scattered throughout most of the nucleus Fig. 6C . Within the IC, high-frequency afferent bands could be isolated in some cases if followed caudally Fig. 6D .Afferent arbors at P8 exhibited numerous branch points Fig. 6E,F and appeared to be more elaborate within afferent bands as compared to axons residing in interband spaces. Postnatal day 12 P12 onset of hearing Organization of the DNLL projection within the IC at the onset of hearing appeared remarkably like that in the adult. Bands were evident in dorsolateral, low-frequency regions of the central nucleus Fig. 7A,B arrowheads . Moreover, in ventromedial, high-frequency regions specific afferent patches were seen for the first time Fig. 7A,C paired arrowheads . In order to correlate afferent distribu-tion with specific subdivisions of the IC, images of afferent labeling were aligned with corresponding images of Nissl-stained sections refer to Fig. 8 . This process provided evidence that a crossed projection from the DNLL to the deep layer of the external cortex of the IC had begun forming by P12 most lateral band in Fig. 7A arrows in Fig 7B,C refer to Fig. 8AâC . Also, for the first time retro-gradely-labeled cells were present throughout the entire DNLL Fig. 7D . While the density of afferent fibers in bands and patches obscured images of single axons, axons located on the periphery of bands and patches were highly branched and more elaborate than P8 arbors Fig. 7E,F . Quantitative analyses. In addition to qualitative observations describing the developmental progression of the projection, quantitative measurements were made, calculating the development of arbor complexity and the extent of DNLL fibers within IC layers. Portions of axons within the central nucleus were reconstructed at P0, P4, and P8. In order to assess whether branching of DNLL axons increased during this developmental period as sug-gested by the qualitative data, the number of branch points per unit length of axon was determined at these three ages Fig. 9A . The results indicate that P0 axons are relatively unbranched, exhibiting on average only 1 0.99 branch point for every 100 Î¼m of axon. Arbors recon-structed at P4 had on average almost twice as many branch points as P0 fibers 1.95 , while P8 axons branched most frequently 2.94 nodes per 100 Î¼m of axon . Length of collaterals and comparisons between preterminal and terminal field branching were not quantitatively assessed. A portion of an arbor reconstructed at P8 is shown in Figure 9B. Notice that the distance between axonal vari-cosities appears to be greatest on the parent segment, while they are more concentrated on the collateral branches. Additional measurements were made in order to quan-tify the extent of DNLL fiber ingrowth in the plane of IC layers at the various postnatal stages Fig. 9C . To compen-sate for the changing size of the midbrain, and thus enable comparisons between developmental groups, a coordinate system of the IC was developed Fig. 9D . The location of labeled axons was normalized by calculating mean percent distances in the laminar plane of the defined area. DNLL fibers occupied a greater percentage of IC layers at the older postnatal stages. While fibers at P12 extended on average 63% of the total distance in the plane of IC layers, the density of label was rarely uniform through any given layer hence the appearance of patches. The location of these afferent dense high-frequency patches was calcu-lated for all P12 cases. Patch location was remarkably consistent among these animals spanning on average the 20 to 41.5% range see asterisk in Fig. 9C , suggesting that crossed projections from the DNLL may occupy specific, functional compartments within the central nucleus of the IC prior to auditory experience.

Comp. Neurol. 416 417â428, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. An important issue in developmental neurobiology is the identification and characterization of inductive signals that regulate the regional determination of neuroepithe-lial cells. Recent efforts have focused on the retinoids, a class of vitamin A derivatives that can have dramatic, dose-dependent effects on the regional patterning of the nervous system when applied exogenously to embryos Dekker et al., 1992 Durston et al., 1989 Forehand et al., 1998 Gale et al., 1996 Glover et al., 1996 Hyatt et al., 1996 Leonard et al., 1995 Marshall et al., 1992 Morriss-Kay et al., 1991 Sundin and Eichele, 1992 Wood et al., 1994 or when endogenous levels are diminished through inhibition of synthesis Forehand et al., 1998 Maden et al., 1996 Marsh-Armstrong et al., 1994 Sockanathan and Jessell, 1998 . The differential distribution of endogenous retinoids in the nervous system Balkan et al., 1992 Colbert et al., 1993 Hogan et al., 1992 Horton and Maden, 1995 Maden et al., 1998 McCaffery and Drager, 1994 Wagner et al., 1990, 1992 , the presence of specific recep-tors in the neuroepithelium Hoover and Glover, 1998 Hoover et al., 1995, 1998 Ruberte et al., 1991, 1993 Smith, 1994 Smith and Eichele, 1991 , and the effects of manipulating receptor gene expression Gould et al., 1998 van der Wees et al., 1998 implicate retinoids as signaling molecules involved in dictating the fates of neuronal precursors. The retinoid receptors belong to the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory factors whose members include the steroid thyroid hormone receptors, the vitamin D3 receptors, and the peroxisomal receptors Kastner et al., 1994 . Molecular cloning has identified five retinoid receptors in chicken Michaille et al., 1994, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a,b Seleiro et al., 1995 Smith and Eichele, 1991 that have been divided into two subtypes on the basis of ligand specificity 1 the retinoic acid receptors RARs a, b, g , which bind both all trans-retinoic acid all-trans RA and 9-cis-retinoic acid 9-cis-RA , and 2 the retinoid X receptors RXRs a, g , which appear to be selectively activated by 9-cis-RA Evans, 1988 Kastner et al., 1994 Mangelsdorf et al., 1992 Rowe and Brickell, 1993 . The functional diversity of retinoid receptors is shown by the existence of multiple receptor isoforms, the ability of the retinoid receptors to form heterodimers, and the presence of multiple response elements in the genome Kastner et al., 1994 Sucov and Evans, 1995 . Given the multiplicity of pathways available to transduce retinoid signals Chambon, 1993 , a more complete description of the distribution of the retinoid receptors is required to elucidate the receptor combinations involved in patterning different regions of the neuroepithelium. In the chicken embryo, the spatial expression patterns of the different retinoid receptors within the neuroepithe-lium remain poorly characterized. To date, only RARb Rowe et al., 1992 Smith, 1994 Smith and Eichele, 1991 and RXRa Hoover and Glover, 1998 Hoover et al., 1995 have been mapped by using in situ hybridization to detect transcripts. RARb and RXRa transcripts are detected at early stages in overlapping, contiguous domains extending caudally from specific levels of the posterior hindbrain through the length of the spinal cord. In the present study, we show that RXRg transcripts are expressed starting at a later stage and in a more discrete pattern within the neuroepithelium. Previous reports have demonstrated the presence of RXRg transcripts in the retina, in premigratory neural crest, in neural crest derivatives in the peripheral nervous system, and in the dorsal mesencephalon of the chicken embryo Hoover et al., 1998 Rowe and Brickell, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a . We extend these observations by reporting on the presence of RXRg transcripts within the mantle zone of the alar plate in several domains of the neural tube, including the hindbrain, optic tectum, cerebel-lar plate, and diencephalon. Within these domains, RXRg transcripts are expressed by discrete populations of cells that are likely to be neurons. These observations demon-strate that RXRg is not only the earliest known marker for the neural crest but also a marker for specific cell popula-tions in the neural tube. The location of these cells in the alar plate suggests that they may derive from dorsal precursors and that they potentially constitute some of the central targets of neural crest-derived sensory neurons. In particular, the domains of RXRg expression appear to presage the locations of the central sensory elements of the trigeminal system, including secondary targets in the cerebellum and diencephalon. This suggests a role for RXRg in the differentiation of a functionally integrated system of central neurons. MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue preparation Fertilized White Italian chicken eggs were obtained from the Norwegian National Institute of Health SIFF, Oslo, Norway and incubated in a humid environment at 38Â°C until they reached the desired developmental stage. All embryos were removed from the egg, anesthetized by hypothermia, staged according to Hamburger and Hamil-ton 1951 , decapitated, and dissected in ice-cold phos-phate buffered saline PBS 10 mM NaPO4, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 . Hatchlings were killed by decapitation and were dissected in PBS. These protocols follow the guidelines of the national ethics committee that regulates animal experi-mentation in Norway. For in situ hybridization experi-ments, embryos were fixed for 2â4 hours in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C with agitation. Whole embryos were first dissected away from extraembryonic mem-branes, and the heart, the roof of the fourth ventricle, and the telencephalon were pierced with a fine needle to facilitate penetration by reagents. Embryos intended for wholemount in situ hybridization were stepped to 100% methanol in a series of PBS 1 0.1% Tween 20 PBT pH 7.4 methanol solutions. The embryos remained in 100% methanol for up to 2 weeks at 220Â°C. Embryos intended for in situ hybridization on sections were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose PBS, sectioned on a cryostat at 15â20 Î¼m, collected onto SuperFrost Plus slides Kebo Labs, Oslo , and stored at 280Â°C until use. For RNA isolation, chicken tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 270Â°C until use. Plasmids and probes For these studies, we used plasmids corresponding to the full-length chicken cDNA RXRg Rowe et al., 1991a . The full-length RXRg cDNA pR2BE was contained within the Bluescript SK1 vector the plasmid was linearized with Hind III, BamH I, or Bal I for use in the in situ hybridization and RNAse protection assays Fig. 1A . To synthesize cRNA probes, templates were transcribed in the presence of [a-32P] radiolabeled UTP or digoxigenin-labeled UTP using the T3 Hind IIIâlinearized template for sense probe or T7 BamH Iâ and Bal Iâlinearized templates for antisense probes RNA polymerases. RNA isolation and RNase protection assay Total RNAwas isolated either through a cesium chloride gradient Chirgwin et al., 1979 or by an acid phenol method Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987 that we modified with an additional digestion to purify the RNA from residual DNA. Briefly, after the final precipitation of the acid phenol method, the RNAwas reconstituted in nuclease-free water and treated with of 1 U ml RQ1 DNAse I Promega, Madison, WI for 1 hour at 37Â°C. The RNA was extracted with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 and precipitated in ethanol at 270Â°C until use. For RNase protection assays, aliquots of RNA from various chicken tissues were mixed with up to 100,000 cpm ml of radioactive cRNA probe in hybridization buffer 0.2 M PIPES, pH 6.5, 50% formamide, 3.7 M NaCl, and 5.0 mM ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid EDTA for 15 hours at 55Â°C. After hybridization, hybrids were digested with 30 U ml of RNase One Promega in buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM sodium acetate for 60 minutes at 37Â°C. Those hybrids surviving digestion were then ethanol precipitated and fractionated in a 6% denatur-ing polyacrylamide gel in 0.089 M Tris, 0.089 M boric acid, plus 0.002 M EDTA, pH 8.0 TBE buffer . The gel was transferred to filter paper, dried, and exposed to X-ray film at 270Â°C until the desired signal-to-noise ratio was reached. The autoradiogram was scanned into a computer and printed. In some instances, hybrids were also digested with RNase A, as described elsewhere Hoover et al., 1998 . In situ hybridization The present in situ hybridization protocol used on sections was a modification of that described by Hoover and Goldman 1992 . Briefly, sections were rehydrated through a series of ethanols before treatment with protein-ase K 1 mM EDTA 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 at 37Â°C for 5 minutes, followed by acetylation with 0.25% acetic anhy-dride in 0.1 M triethanolamine, pH 8.0. Sections were then hybridized with single-stranded digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes in hybridization solution 50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1 mM dithiothri-etol [DTT], and 1% blocking buffer in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and sealed under coverslips in a humid chamber for 12â16 hours at 55Â°C. Posthybridization treatment involved 1 a rinse in 23 standard saline citrate SSC at 22Â°C, 2 a wash in 50% formamide 10 mM DTT in 23 SSC at 55Â°C, 3 digestion in RNase A 50 mg ml in 1 mM EDTA 0.5 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at 37Â°C, and 4 a wash in 1 mM EDTA 0.5 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, at 65Â°C. After posthybridization treatment, sections were blocked for 3â4 hours in 1% blocking reagent stock Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN 0.05% Triton X-100 in 23 SSC, washed twice for 5 minutes each in maleate buffer 150 mM NaCl in 100 mM maleic acid, pH 7.5 , and then incubated overnight with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phos-phatase conjugate in maleate buffer containing 1% block-ing reagent stock and 0.3% Triton X-100. After washing twice for 10 minutes each in maleate buffer, slides were washed in 100 mM NaCl 50 mM MgCl2 in 100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, and incubated overnight in freshly prepared nitroblue tetrazolium chromagen substrate Genius 3 Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, Boehringer Mannheim . After the color reaction was complete usually 12â20 hours , the sections were washed for 30 minutes in 0.9% NaCl 1 mM EDTA in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5, dehydrated, and coverslipped. The wholemount in situ hybridization assays were per-formed by using a protocol very similar to that of Nieto et al. 1996 , with the following modifications. Embryos were rehydrated from methanol into PBT pH 7.4 and then bleached in 6% hydrogen peroxide Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI in PBT for 60 minutes. After several PBT rinses, embryos were digested with 10 Î¼g ml proteinase K in PBT for 30 minutes, incubated in 2 mg ml glycine in PBT for 5 minutes, and rinsed with PBT before refixing. Incubation in prehybridization solution was for 1 hour at 70Â°C. The hybridization solution contained approximately 1 Î¼g ml denatured cRNA probe. Posthybridization washes were at 70Â°C, and unhybridized probe was removed by either RNase A 100 Î¼g ml Sigma, St. Louis, MO or RNase One 100 U ml Promega , with a subsequent wash at 65Â°C. The embryos were preblocked with 10% heat-inactivated goat serum. The anti-digoxigenin antibody was preadsorbed with chicken embryo powder. The NTMT wash solution Nieto et al., 1996 contained 0.1% Tween 20 rather than Triton X-100 Sigma and 2 mM levamisole Sigma . The alkaline phosphatase reaction solution contained 450 Î¼g ml nitroblue tetrazolium salt Promega and 175 Î¼g ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate Promega . After in situ hybridization, the embryos were photo-graphed as wholemounts and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose PBS before being sectioned on a cryostat at 20â25 Î¼m. We performed in situ hybridization experiments on 40 embryos ranging from stage 10 to stage 22.5. The results at any given stage were similar and consistent. Sense RNA probes were used as negative controls for in situ hybridiza-tion experiments and consistently produced no signal above background level. Regions of the embryo previously reported to express the RXRg gene, such as the liver and the peripheral ganglia Rowe et al., 1991a , were examined routinely to check the specificity of the probes. Retrograde labeling of central trigeminal neurons Central trigeminal neurons were labeled retrogradely and trigeminal nerve afferents were labeled anterogradely by applying biotin dextran-amine BDA 3,000 MW Molecu-lar Probes, Eugene, OR to the cut trigeminal nerve with the procedure of Glover 1995 . Production of photomicrographs Sections were photographed by using conventional tech-niques. The film images were imported into Adobe Photo-shop, version 4.0, by using a Polaroid Sprint scan slide scanner. The brightness and contrast of the scanned images were adjusted by using the AutoLevels function, which expands the pixel value distribution of the image to fill the available gray-scale range but does not change the information content. Cropping was performed to adjust the final size. The images were imported into Pagemaker, version 6.0, where text and symbols were added. The figures were printed on a Tektronix dye-sublimation printer at 300 dpi. At no point were image features erased or added. DISCUSSION Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of RXRg transcripts in liver, retina, migratory neural crest, and the peripheral nervous system of the chicken embryo Hoover et al., 1998 Rowe and Brickell, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a Seleiro et al., 1994 . In the present study, we used nonradioactive in situ hybridization assays to show that the RXRg gene is also expressed in specific regions of the developing central nervous system. RXRg gene transcripts are detectable in discrete cell populations in the diencepha-lon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, and hindbrain. The loca-tion of the RXRg-positive cells within the mantle zone of the neural tube strongly suggests that they are postmi-totic, and their stages of appearance argue that they are most likely neurons. They are not likely to be oligodendro-cytes. Oligodendrocyte generation begins after day 7 about stage 31 from ventrally located oligodendrocyte progeni-tors in the spinal cord of the chicken embryo Pringle et al., 1996 . Although in the mouse embryo oligodendrocyte generation in hindbrain precedes that in spinal cord Timsit et al., 1995 , a similar time lead in the chicken embryo would still place oligodendrocyte generation and migration into the mantle zone to well after the RXRg-positive cell populations are present. In recent years, the expression domains of several transcription factors and signaling molecules have been related to specific longitudinal columns and axon tracts in the developing central nervous system Shimamura et al., 1995 Logan et al., 1998 . To our knowledge, this is the first report that indicates such a relation for a retinoid receptor. Moreover, RXRg expression in a longitudinal column along a limited stretch of the neuraxis suggests a relation to a functionally specific subpopulation of cells. We discuss below the implications of this expression pattern with respect to the potential origin and functional identities of the RXRg-positive cells. Pan-neural crest or pan-dorsal neural tube progenitor descendents? RXRg transcripts evidently are expressed by all migrat-ing neural crest cells Rowe and Brickell, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a . Although expression in the ectomesenchymal de-rivatives of the facial primordia is transient Rowe et al., 1994 , expression in cranial peripheral ganglia and nerves is sustained at least until stage 27 Rowe et al., 1991a present study . RXRg transcripts also are expressed by the centrally located neural crest-derived neurons of the mes-encephalic trigeminal sensory nucleus Rowe and Brickell, 1995 present study . These neurons evidently migrate into the optic tectum from the leptomeninges after emigrat-ing to the periphery with the rest of the mesencephalic neural crest Narayanan and Narayanan, 1978 von Bar-theld and Bothwell, 1993 . In several preparations, we observed RXRg-positive cells within the leptomeninges overlying the tectal midline. Thus, RXRg appears to be a pan-migratory neural crest marker in the chicken embryo, with downregulation in specific non-neural cell types at postmigratory stages. Is the RXRg expression by neural crest derivatives related to the RXRg expression exhibited by the other cell populations within the neural tube? The localization of RXRg-positive cells to the alar plate in the rhombencepha-lon is consistent with, although not proof of, a derivation from progenitors in the dorsal neural tube. Cell lineage tracing in the chicken and mouse embryos has demon-strated the presence of progenitors in the dorsal neural tube that give rise to both migratory neural crest cells and cells including neurons that remain within the neural tube Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988, 1989 Serbedzija et al., 1994 . This has been most thoroughly documented for the trunk neural crest, but a few tracing experiments have demonstrated the same phenomenon in the cranial neural crest Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988 . We sug-gest that RXRg expression is a molecular link between the peripheral and central descendents of these dorsal progeni-tors. If true, this would indicate that at least some of the central descendents remain clustered at specific locations within the alar plate. Coordinate expression in components of the trigeminal system? In the mesencephalon, the RXRg-positive cells lie along the midline at the posterior aspect of the optic tectum. These cells have been identified as mesencephalic trigemi-nal sensory neurons, both by virtue of this specific location Rowe and Brickell, 1995 present study and by direct comparison with the retrogradely labeled sensory neurons present study . Comparison to other studies that have labeled this nucleus either retrogradely or with cytochemi-cal markers at later stages supports our conclusion that the RXRg-positive cells represent the mesencephalic tri-geminal sensory neurons Scott et al., 1994 von Bartheld and Bothwell, 1993 . The location of the RXRg-positive cells in the rhombence-phalic alar plate indicates that they are associated with sensory columns and tracts and are, therefore, potential synaptic partners of peripheral RXRg-positive neural crest cells that populate cranial sensory ganglia. Comparison with the anterograde labeling of trigeminal nerve affer-ents and with previous descriptions of the trigeminal system in birds Arends and Dubbeldam, 1984 suggests that the longitudinal column of RXRg-positive cells in the rhombencephalon relates to the principal and descending trigeminal sensory nuclei but not to the trigeminal motor nucleus. A direct correlation is difficult to make with the material available because the trigeminal system can only be mapped completely at later stages. We attempted in situ hybridization on tissue sections through the brain-stem at later stages but were unsuccessful in obtaining convincing label, presumably because expression levels fall. Thus, RXRg transcript expression may represent an incipient pattern that presages the location of specific sensory populations at later stages. A conspicuous point of conformity between this pattern and the trigeminal sen-sory nuclei is the caudal limit of RXRg expression in the upper cervical spinal cord, which relates to the caudal limit of the descending trigeminal nucleus in the third cervical segment Arends and Dubbeldam, 1984 .An impor-tant discrepancy is the absence of RXRg expression in r3. MarÄ± Â´n and Puelles 1995 used quail chicken embryo chimeras to fate map the trigeminal system in the chicken embryo and found that the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus is derived from r1 and the descending trigeminal nucleus contiguously from r2â8, with no sign of a gap in r3. The RXRg-positive cells in the cerebellar plate and in the diencephalon clearly do not relate to the trigeminal sensory nuclei, but they could relate to downstream projec-tions within the trigeminal system or other sensory systems . The subnucleus oralis of the descending trigemi-nal nucleus projects to a few specific contiguous cerebellar lobules in adult ducks and pigeons Arends et al., 1984 Arends and Zeigler, 1989 , a domain that is consistent with the band of RXRg-positive cells in the cerebellar plate. Projections from the trigeminal sensory nuclei to dience-phalic and telencephalic targets also have been described in birds Arends et al., 1984 Wild et al., 1985 . Previous studies of gene expression patterns have sug-gested that coordinate expression of a given transcription factor or combination of transcription factors may be involved in the recognition of synaptic partners both within the central nervous system and between peripheral neurons and central targets Logan et al., 1998 Saito et al., 1995 Tiveron et al., 1996 . A strong case for such a relation has been made recently for the matching of muscle sensory afferents and motoneurons in spinal stretch reflex circuitry Lin et al., 1998 . The expression pattern of RXRg implicates this specific retinoid receptor as another tran-scription factor potentially involved in specifying synaptic connectivity among functionally related neuron popula-tions. Comparison with other retinoid receptors in the chicken embryo Before the present study, of the five retinoid receptors identified in the chicken, only the RARb and RXRa expres-sion patterns had been mapped in detail in the neural tube Hoover and Glover, 1998 Hoover et al., 1995 Rowe et al., 1992 Smith, 1994 Smith and Eichele, 1991 . The RARb and RXRa expression patterns differ from the RXRg expression pattern in three important ways. First, RARb and RXRa transcripts are first detectable in the neural tube at stages prior to the formation of rhombomeres, whereas RXRg transcripts are first detectable in the neural tube after the formation of rhombomeres. Second, RARb and RXRa transcripts are expressed in continuous longitudinal domains spanning most of the mediolateral axis and with a rostral limit in the hindbrain. RARb transcripts are expressed from the r4â5 boundary caudad into the spinal cord, and RXRa transcripts are expressed from the r6â7 boundary caudad into the spinal cord Hoover et al., 1995 Rowe et al., 1992 Smith, 1994 Smith and Eichele, 1991 for review, see Hoover and Glover, 1998 . By contrast, RXRg transcripts evidently are never expressed in a continuous domain that spans the mediolat-eral axis but rather in a narrow, intermittent, longitudinal domain from diencephalic to upper cervical levels. Third, RXRa and probably RARb transcripts are expressed in the proliferative ventricular zone at noticeably higher levels than in the mantle zone Hoover and Glover, 1998 and thus are expressed predominantly by progenitor cells although at later stages RARb transcripts are expressed by spinal motoneurons Muto et al., 1991 . By contrast, RXRg transcripts are expressed at detectable levels exclu-sively in the mantle zone and thus presumably only by postmitotic cells. On the basis of these differences, RARb and RXRa may be involved in the segmental patterning of the hindbrain, potentially mediating inductive influences on hindbrain progenitors, whereas RXRg seems more likely to be in-volved in the differentiation of specific neuron populations. Figure 8 shows a comparison of the expression patterns of RXRg, RXRa, and RARb transcripts in the neural tube of the chicken embryo. Double-labeling studies will be necessary to determine whether any cells of the neural tube coexpress RXRg and other retinoid receptors, and a definitive answer will require an analysis at the protein level using immunohis-tochemistry. Antibodies directed against the various mem-bers of the chicken retinoid receptor family are, as far as we know, currently unavailable. The evidence from in situ hybridization nevertheless suggests that RXRg is not coexpressed with RARb or RXRa except in the most caudal portion of its range. By contrast, RXRg might be co-expressed throughout its range with RARa or RARg, transcripts of which have been reported in brief to have a widespread expression within the neural tube of the chicken embryo Michaille et al., 1994, 1995 . Two RXRg isoforms, RXRg1 and RXRg2, are expressed in the chicken embryo. RXRg2 is the predominant species in retina and dorsal root ganglia, whereas RXRg1 is the predominant species in liver Hoover et al., 1998 Seleiro et al., 1994 . This suggests that RXRg2 may be a neural-specific isoform, a feature that could be tested further by examining the differential expression of the two isoforms in the brainstem. In particular, it would be of interest to know whether expression within the RXRg-positive popu- lations in the brainstem is heterogeneous. We have not performed RNase protection assays to address this issue because of the large amount of tissue that would be required to assay the different cell populations separately. Moreover, our attempts at producing isoform-specific probes that function well for in situ hybridization have been unsuccessful. Thus, this issue must remain unresolved until an appropriate technique for detecting and discrimi-nating the isoforms at high spatial resolution, for example, by immunohistochemistry, is available. Comparison to RXRg expression in the mouse The distribution of RXRg transcripts in the neural tube of the mouse embryo is different from that in the chicken embryo. In the mouse embryo, RXRg transcripts have been detected in the developing forebrain, diencephalon, and ventral horns of the spinal cord, colocalized with RARg transcripts in the forebrain and spinal cord Dolle et al., 1994 . RXRg thus exhibits species-specific differences both in its regional pattern of expression in the neural tube and in the potential for heterodimerism with other retinoid receptors. The same holds true in the developing retina, where RXRg transcripts are expressed almost exclusively by photoreceptors in the chicken embryo Hoover et al., 1998 but by ganglion cells in the mouse Dolle et al., 1994 and by amacrine and ganglion cells and retinal progenitor cells in the rat Kelley et al., 1994, 1995a,b . These and other findings Hoover and Glover, 1998 Hoover et al., 1998 document the existence of major species-specific differences in the expression of retinoid receptors and argue against making generalized state-ments on the basis of single species studies. RESULTS Probe specificity In situ hybridization assays were performed on both wholemount preparations and sections using digoxigeninlabeled cRNA probes to identify RXRg gene expression in the central nervous system. Because we describe new information with probes similar to those used in previous studies Rowe et al., 1991a , we checked the probe specific-ity by using multiple criteria. First, RNase protections produced only a single band corresponding to a full-length transcript Fig. 1B . This cannot result from cross hybrid-ization to transcripts of other retinoid receptors because of the stringency of the RNase One digestion. Second, the selective tissue distribution of RXRg transcripts obtained from the RNase protections matched that of previous descriptions Rowe and Brickell, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a Seleiro et al., 1994 and is not appropriate for the reported tissue distributions of other retinoid receptors Hoover et al., 1995 Michaille et al., 1994, 1995 Rowe et al., 1992 Seleiro et al., 1995 Smith and Eichele, 1991 . Third, as will be described in more detail below, the pattern of in situ hybridization in the periphery matched that of previous descriptions Rowe and Brickell, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a , whereas the pattern of in situ hybridization in the neural tube differed from that of RARb or RXRa cf. Hoover and Glover, 1998 . In separate studies, the specificity of the same probe has been assessed by nucleic acid dot blotting Hoover et al., 1998 , and the distribution of RXRg tran-scripts in the retina differs from that of the other four chicken retinoid receptors as assessed by in situ hybridiza-tion Hoover and Glover, 1996 unpublished observations . Expression of RXRg in the periphery At the earliest stage examined, stage 10, we detected RXRg transcripts in migratory neural crest and the very most dorsal cells of the neural tube, presumably represent-ing premigratory neural crest not shown . By stages 11 and 12, we detected RXRg transcripts in the migratory neural crest but not in the neural tube Fig. 2 . At later stages, we detected RXRg transcripts in all crest-derived peripheral ganglia and in the Schwann cells of the cranial nerves Figs. 3â5 , as previously reported Rowe and Brickell, 1995 Rowe et al., 1991a . Expression of RXRg in the neural tube By stage 13, we detected transcripts within the neural tube in a population of cells at the dorsal midline of the posterior aspect of the mesencephalic optic tectum Fig. 3A,B . By stage 15, we detected RXRg-positive cells also within the rhombencephalon. These cells were ini-tially few in number and occupied a lateral position within the mantle zone, where postmitotic neurons accumulate Fig. 3BâD . Initially they constituted an intermittant longitudinal column, beginning just rostral to the trigemi-nal nucleus and extending just caudal to the otic vesicle, with an absence of detectable expression in a stretch roughly in register with rhombomere 3 Figs. 4, 5 . By stages 17â19, there was an increase in the number of RXRg-positive cells within this column and an increase in its rostrocaudal extent, with RXRg-positive cells now detected in the cerebellar plate Fig. 3A,B and into the cervical spinal cord Fig. 5D . By stage 19, we also detected RXRg-positive cells in the mantle zone of the diencephalon Figs. 4D, 6 . Expression continued in the same pattern until at least stage 22.5, the latest stage we examined. Comparison to central trigeminal neurons and trigeminal nerve afferent targets To provide landmarks for an initial evaluation of the identity of the RXRg-positive cells, we labeled the trigemi- nal nerve on one side retrogradely with biotin-conjugated dextran-amine in six embryos at stages 24â26, the earliest stages at which we could reliably label all the central trigeminal sensory nuclei unpublished observations . Mes-encephalic trigeminal sensory neurons were labeled ipsilat-erally near the dorsal midline at the posterior aspect of the optic tectum Fig. 7A , and central terminals of the trigemi-nal afferents were labeled ipsilaterally within the princi-pal trigeminal sensory nucleus not shown and the spinal trigeminal nucleus Fig. 7B . Comparison with Figure 3 shows a correspondence of these central elements of the trigeminal system to the locations of RXRg-positive cells in the mesencephalon and hindbrain, respectively. The num-ber of retrogradely labeled mesencephalic sensory neurons was low relative to the number of RXRg-positive cells in the posterior optic tectum at the same stages, presumably reflecting the immaturity of their axonal projection von Bartheld and Bothwell, 1993 see Discussion .

Neurol. 416 429â450, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Although there is considerable variability in the origins, course, spinal extent and specific sites of termination of the pyramidal or corticospinal tract in different mamma-lian species, its ubiquitous presence is considered almost a defining characteristic of brain organization in the Class Kuypers, 1981 . Thus, nonmammalian vertebrates are not generally thought to have a pyramidal tract, if for no other reason than that they do not have a laminated neocortex from which such a tract could arise. In birds, however, a multilaminated elevation on the dorsum of the frontal telencephalon, the Wulst, is often considered com-parable with parts of mammalian neocortex e.g., Karten, 1969 Nauta and Karten, 1970 Karten and Shimizu, 1989 . On the basis of its differential afferents and efferents and its differential response to sensory stimuli, the Wulst has been divided into two main regions, a large visual part located more caudally and a smaller somatosensory part that extends to the rostral pole of the brain Revzin, 1969 Delius and Bennetto, 1972 Karten et al., 1973 Karten et al., 1978 Wild, 1987 Wild, 1997 Funke, 1989a Funke, 1989b . The most superficial lamina of the Wulst is known as the hyperstriatum accessorium HA , which lies more medially at rostral levels and more dorsally at caudal levels. HA is bordered laterally or ventrally, respectively, by a narrower, small-cell lamina called the intercalated hyperstriatum accessorium IHA , which at rostral levels of the Wulst receives most of the terminations of the principal somatosensory nucleus of the dorsal thalamus Wild, 1987 Wild, 1997 Funke, 1989b . HA has long been known to be the origin of the so-called septomesencephalic tract TSM , which is the major outflow from dorsal regions of the rostral telencephalon early studies re-viewed in Ariens-Kappers et al., 1960 see also Reiner and Karten, 1983 . The dorsal ramus of this tract, which has been thought to originate largely from visual regions of the Wulst, projects on the optic tectum and visual nuclei of the thalamus and pretectum Karten et al., 1973 Bagnoli et al., 1980 Miceli et al., 1987 Gu Â¨ntu Â¨rku Â¨n et al., 1993 , but its basal or ventral ramus passes further caudally, appar-ently to a variable extent in different species Wallenberg, 1906 Adamo, 1967 Dubbeldam, 1976 . In an owl, Karten 1971 briefly reported a long descending tract that origi-nated in the Wulst and entered the upper cervical spinal cord. Likewise in psittacines, Kalischerâs 1905 tractus ââcortico-septo-spinalisââand Zechaâs 1962 ââpyramidal tractââ were both described as occupying a position at the base of the medulla corresponding to that of the pyramid in mammals and were observed to enter the upper cervical spinal cord Kalischer or to terminate chiefly in the dorsal column nulcei Zecha . However, no study using retrograde tracing techniques has thus far confirmed a telencephalic origin of any long descending tract that might enter the spinal cord in birds, including parrots Cabot et al., 1982 Gross and Oppenheim, 1985 Webster and Steeves, 1988 Webster et al., 1990 . This negative evidence and the lack of any detailed or comprehensive modern account of the projections of the rostral Wulst in birds has apparently contributed to the general view, mentioned above, that pallial projections to the spinal cord are present only in mammals e.g., Nudo and Masterton, 1988 . In the present study, we investigated the possibility that the rostral HA was the origin of an avian pyramidal tract in two species of passerines. In both pigeons and owls, neurons in this part of the brain have been shown to project at least as far as the red nucleus, a major target of descending projections arising in association with the corticospinal pyramidal tract in mammals Karten, 1971 Kuypers, 1981 Armand, 1982 Wild, 1987 Wild, 1992 . The results of the present study confirmed the presence of a long descending tract that terminated in the red nucleus, among many other targets, that partly occupied a position at the base of the medulla, and that entered the cervical spinal cord predominantly ipsilaterally, and terminated predominantly contralaterally at the base of the dorsal horn. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata and eight green finches Carduelis chloris served as subjects. Surgical procedures were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Commit-tee of the University of Auckland. Each bird was anesthe-tized with an intramuscular injection of an equal parts mixture of ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 20 mg kg and placed in a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus with the head tilted down at 45Â° to the horizontal Stokes et al., 1974 . Some of the injections were used to define anterograde projections, whereas others were used to verify the origin of these projections by retrograde transport. Some birds received injections of different tracers into different nuclei on opposite sides of the brain, either to juxtapose afferent and efferent projections or simply to maximize the yield of data per bird. All injections were made by using glass micropipettes outer diameter 10â30 Î¼m and with either air pressure delivered via a picospritzer General Valve, Fairfield, NJ , or iontophoresis 4 Î¼A positive current, 7 seconds on, 7 seconds off for 15â30 minutes . Tracers used were biotinylated dextran amine BDA Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR 10,000 molecular weight [MW], lysine fixable, 10% in phosphate-buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4, and 1â2% cholera toxin B-chain, either unconjugated CTB List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA or conjugated to horseradish peroxidase McIlhinney et al., 1988 . Unilateral injections were made into the V-shaped HA of the rostral Wulst in 6 green finches and 14 zebra finches. In three of the zebra finches the injections were placed dorsally in the lamina, one dorsolaterally, one in the middle of the widest part of the ââVââ, and one dorsomedially. In the remainder, and in the green finches, the injections were made more ventrally at various locations in the apex of HA. Placement of the injections was guided by electro-physiological responses to somatosensory stimuli evoked largely in IHA, the somatosensory thalamorecipient lamina that defines the ventrolateral boundary of HA at the most rostral levels of the brain. Tungsten microelectrodes, insu-lated except at their tips Frederick Haer, 3â5 MV , were used to record multiunit activity and potentials evoked by somatosensory stimuli applied to contralateral parts of the body in the form of air puffs, feather tweaks, taps, etc. Wild, 1987 Wild, 1989 Wild, 1992 Wild, 1995 Wild, 1997 . Neural responses were monitored oscillographically and over a loud speaker. After functional identification of the ventrolateral boundary of HA, the tungsten electrode was replaced by a tracer-filled glass micropipette, and injections of various sizes were made in different cases by using one or more pipette penetrations. For large injec-tions, two or three penetrations were made in the mediolat-eral direction, and picospritzer deposits of tracer were made at several depths in the dorsoventral direction. For smaller injections, a single pipette penetration was made at a stipulated depth in HA, and the tracer was deposited iontophoretically. To verify the origin of the projections within HA and to determine whether the projections to different targets arose from the same or different locations within HA, injections of CTB were made into the dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei, and other regions of the dorsolat-eral medulla n 5 4 , the medial mesencephalon, including the red nucleus and prerubral field n 5 2 , the intercollicu-lar nucleus of the midbrain medial to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus ICo n 5 2 , the nucleus spiriformis medialis SpM n 5 4 , and the stratum cellulare externum SCE of the hypothalamus n 5 1 . Placement of most of these injections was also guided electrophysiologically by recording neural responses to somatosensory stimuli ei-ther in the nucleus itself Wild, 1989, 1995, 1997 or, in the case of SpM, in the suprajacent nucleus uvaeformis Uva Wild, 1994 . The injection in the hypothalamus was made at the rostrocaudal level of the auditory nucleus ovoidalis, which was physiologically identified by using 1-millisec-ond click stimuli delivered via a hollow ear bar. Survival times varied from 2 to 7 days, depending on the tracer and intra-axonal transport times. Birds were deeply anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of an over-dose of ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 20 mg kg and perfused though the heart with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were postfixed for 5â15 hours, removed from the skull, and equilibrated overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4. Serial transverse or parasagittal sections from the entire brain were cut at 30 Î¼m on a freezing microtome and collected in four series. Spinal cord sections were cut either transversely or longitudinally from cervical, brachial, and lumbosacral regions. For immunohistochemistry, sections were pretreated with 50% methanol containing 3% H2O2 and thoroughly washed in PBS. BDA was visualized by using Streptavidin peroxidase conjugate Molecular Probes, Inc. 1 1,000 in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 1â2 hours at room temperature , followed by 0.025% 3,38-diamino benzidine DAB and H2O2. CTB was visualized by using a polyclonal antibody raised in goat List Biologi-cal Laboratories at a dilution of 1 30,000 for 15 hours at 4Â°C, followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG second- ary antibody Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO , 1 500 for 1 hour at room temperature, Streptavidin peroxi-dase conjugate, 1 1,000 1 hour at room temperature, and finally DAB and H2O2. If BDA and CTB were injected in the same bird, the reaction product of the former was first colored black by the addition of 0.002% CoCl2 to the DAB mixture, whereas that of the latter was left brown with no added CoCl2. CTB-HRP was visualized by using tetra-methyl benzidine, according to the method of Mesulam 1978 . At least one series of sections was counterstained with either Cresyl Violet, Giemsa, or Neutral Red for the identification of neuronal groups. Labeled structures were photographed and or drawn with the aid of a drawing tube, and these drawings were scanned into a Macintosh 7100 80 PowerMac computer and redrawn and labeled by using Canvas Pica . DISCUSSION Long descending projections that reach at least as far as the upper cervical spinal cord have been reported to originate from two regions of the avian telencephalon Kalischer, 1905 Zecha, 1962 Karten, 1971 Zeier and Karten, 1971 Dubbeldam et al., 1997 . One is the archis-triatum, the outflow from which via the occipitomesence-phalic tract in the dorsolateral tegmentum is said to resemble Bagleyâs corticotegmental tract or bundle in ungulates Bagley, 1922 Haarsten and Verhaart, 1967 . The other is the subject of the present study, namely, the hyperstriatum accessorium HA , the projections of which through the ventral brainstem were suggested by Ka-lischer 1905 and Zecha 1962 to be akin to the pyramidal tract of mammals. This suggestion is strongly reinforced by the present results, summarized in Figure 14, which demonstate a striking resemblance between the extratelen-cephalic projections of the rostral Wulst in finches and the pyramidal or corticospinal tract of mammals. Of course, birds do not possess a pyramidal shaped structure at the base of the medulla, and although they may have neurons in HA that are the equivalent of neurons in layer VâVI of mammalian isocortex, in the sense that they project to thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord, they are not pyrami-dal in shape. Strictly speaking, therefore, the term ââpyra-midal tractââis not an appropriate designation for the basal or ventral branch of TSM. Nevertheless, the concept of a pyramidal tract in mammals was for centuries less con-cerned with the cell types of origin, or their laminar location, than with the origins of the tract in the cerebral cortex, its partial decussation at the spinomedullary junc-tion, and its involvement in the contralateral clinical manifestations of various brain lesions Armand, 1982 . The present study has corroborated Zechaâs 1962 claim that a long pyramidal-like tract originates in the dorsal telencephalon of birds and follows a trajectory through the brainstem like that of mammals, with predominantly contralateral terminations in the dorsal column nuclei. It also confirms Kalischerâs 1905 and Kartenâs 1971 find- ings in the parrot and owl, respectively, that the tract originates in the rostral part of the Wulst and that it actually enters the spinal cord in fact, in the two species of passerines studied here, we have shown that it projects at least as far as C7. But, unlike the case for the owl, the projections in the finches did not for the most part decus-sate at the bulbospinal junction, but descended largely ipsilaterally in the inner margin of the lateral funiculus, rather than the dorsal funiculus, as in the owl, before terminating predominantly contralaterally. Species differences in the presence or absence of a pyramidal decussation, funicular trajectory, and rostrocau-dal extent are also a feature of the mammalian pyramidal or corticospinal tract Kuypers, 1981 Palmieri et al., 1993 .As in finches, there is little or no pyramidal decussa-tion in the hedgehog, mole, klipdassie, or procavia, but in these mammalian species the corticospinal tract travels in the ventral funiculus. The pyramidal tract in finches resembles that in the so-called primitive group of mam-mals, such as hedgehog, rabbit, goat, sloth, armadillo, and elephant, in terminating at relatively high spinal levels and predominantly in the base of the dorsal horn Ver-haart, 1967 Kuypers, 1981 Palmieri et al., 1993 . More generally, however, the predominantly contralateral termi-nation of the pyramidal tract in finches resembles that in most mammals, including the uncrossed component of the pyramidal tract in primates, which also crosses before terminating Kuypers, 1981 Schoenen and Grant, 1990 . Also like the mammalian pyramidal tract, most of the individual fibers of the comparable tract in birds appear to be rather thin moreover, their pattern of termination at brainstem levels is distinctly mammalian-like.As in mam-mals, these terminations can be grouped into those related to cells of origin of descending brainstem pathways, those related to cerebellar relay nuclei, and those related to relay nuclei of ascending sensory systems Armand, 1982 . Relation to cells of origin of descending brainstem pathways The first group is largely related to the red nucleus, as previously noted by Karten 1971 in an owl and by Wild 1992 in pigeons. The red nucleus in birds projects to all levels of the spinal cord Wild et al., 1979 Cabot et al., 1982 Webster and Steeves, 1988 Webster et al., 1990 , predominantly contralaterally, so that, even though HA does not appear to project beyond midcervical levels, its influence may be relayed to all spinal levels via the HA-rubrospinal pathway. What kind of influence this might be is currently unknown, partly because there is no information on the role of the red nucleus in birds in either motor or sensory functions. The predominant locus of termination of rubrospinal fibers in the base of the dorsal horn and intermediate area in pigeons Wild et al., 1979 might suggest a role in either the control of sensory input and or the modulation of spinal refex circuitry via spinal interneurons, rather than one concerned directly with motor control. It is also not known whether, as in mam-mals, some of the fibers projecting to the red nucleus from HA are collaterals of those projecting to the spinal cord. Other HA projections to cells of origin of descending brainstem pathways may involve various groups of rhomb-encephalic neurons. In the upper pons, the diffuse projec-tion of the HA to the ventrolateral tegmentum is likely to include neurons of nucleus subcoeruleus ventralis, which in other avian species has been shown to be a significant source of descending projections to the cord Cabot et al., 1982 Webster and Steeves, 1988 . Other pontine and medullary reticulospinal neurons may also be targeted by HA projections, but until double retrograde-anterograde labeling studies are performed, this must remain speculative. Relation to cerebellar relay nuclei The medial spiriform nucleus SpM in the caudal thalamus is by far the most prominent nucleus in this category, with an extremely dense pattern of terminations in the dorsal and rostral parts of this nucleus. The ventral part of SpM, or at least part of it, receives an equally dense projection from the major telencephalic outflow of the caudal hemisphere, namely the archistriatum Zeier and Karten, 1971 Wild, 1992 Wild and Farabaugh, 1996 . All parts of SpM provide the cerebellum with extensive mossy fiber projections Karten and Finger, 1976 Wild, 1992 present study . A homologue of this nucleus in mammals is unknown. The red nucleus may also relay HA projections to the cerebellum, for in birds, and possibly in some reptiles, there is a rubrocerebellar projection to both the deep nuclei and cortex see Fig. 8c Wild, 1992 Ku Â¨nzle, 1983 . HA also projects to two other precerebellar relay nuclei, namely the medial pontine nucleus PM and the inferior olive Wild, 1992 present study . In birds, PM is a compact nucleus in the base of the pontine tegmentum and resembles the pontine nuclei of mammals in its projections to the cerebel-lum via the contralateral brachium pontis Brodal et al., 1950 . However, although not specifically identified as nuclei, there are in birds many other neurons scattered throughout the pontine tegmentum that project to the cerebellum present and unpublished results , but whether any of these also receive a projection from HA will have to be determined in future studies. The HA projection to the inferior olive is to the same part, the lateral part of the ventral lamella, that receives a projection from the dorsal column nuclei Arends et al., 1984 Wild, 1989 . Somatosen-sory somatomotor information in thereby routed to the cerebellum via three separate systems the climbing fiber system via the olive, the mossy fiber system via SpM and PM, and the ââmultilayerââ fiber system Haines et al., 1986 via a direct projection from HA to the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei Wild and Williams, unpublished observa-tions . Relation to sensory relay nuclei The major nuclei in this category are the dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei in the caudal medulla, possi-bly certain cells in the cervical spinal cord, but not the sensory trigeminal nuclei. Whether the subtrigeminal region, which received the densest termination of projec-tions to the caudolateral medulla, may also have a role as a sensory relay is not clear because the specific projections of this region have not been well defined. Generally, however, the HA projections to lateral and dorsal regions of the caudal medulla and to the cervical spinal cord seem likely to be primarily concerned with the control of somatosen-sory input arising in the body, and to some extent the beak, the latter because of the trigeminal projections to the external cuneate nucleus in birds Dubbeldam and Karten, 1978 Wild and Zeigler, 1996 . In birds, this nucleus is probably not homologous with its mammalian namesake, in that it is not exclusively concerned with upper limb proprioception, but receives primary spinal and trigeminal afferent projections mediating cutaneous and deep sensa-tion, rather than muscle spindle inputs Van den Akker, 1970 Wild, 1985 Dubbeldam and Karten, 1978 Wild and Zeigler, 1996 Reinke and Necker, 1996 . Regarding a possible cervical spinal relay, in both pigeons and passe-rines primary afferent projections from the wing have been shown to terminate specifically in medial lamina V at the base of the dorsal horn in all cervical segments rostral to the brachial enlargement Wild, 1985 Wild, 1997 Schulte and Necker, 1994 , and cells in this general location at upper cervical levels, along with those from the dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei, project to somatosen-sory regions of the mesencephalon and thalamus Wild, 1995 Wild, 1997 present study . In fact, Wild 1995 suggested that the spinal neurons in medial lamina V may actually comprise a caudal extension of the dorsal column nuclei but see Schulte and Necker, 1994 for an alternative interpretation . In the present study, the HA projections to the cervical cord, whether they descended in the lateral funiculus or through the base of the dorsal horn, termi-nated predominantly in the vicinity of medial lamina V, bilaterally but predominantly contralaterally and, hence, may be part of the same descending system for the control of sensory input derived mainly from the contralateral side of the body. The apparent lack of a major projection from HA to the sensory trigeminal nuclei is noteworthy from both avian and comparative points of view. In birds, the pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus receives dense projections from the alternative somatosensorimotor outflow from the telencephalon, i.e., from the archistriatum via the occipito-mesencephalic tract OM Zeier and Karten, 1971 Wild, unpublished observations . This division of origin of de-scending projections to sensory relay nuclei i.e., Wulst versus archistriatum is probably a reflection of the fact that a sensory trigeminal representation has not been found in the rostral Wulst, but instead is found in nucleus basalis, most of the multisynaptic projections from which eventually reach the archistriatum, rather than the Wulst Wild et al., 1985 Wild and Farabaugh, 1996 . As men-tioned above, the outflow from the archistriatum to brain-stem levels is via OM, which is said to resemble Bagleyâs bundle in ungulates. This comparison receives some sup-port from the fact that, in the goat, it is this bundle rather than the pyramidal tract itself that terminates in the spinal trigeminal nucleus Haarsten and Verhaart, 1967 . However, in the goat, the Bagley bundle and the pyramidal tract originate from the same area of cortex, whereas in birds OM and the pyramidal tract originate from two entirely different areas of the pallium. In addition to this comparison, the pyramidal tract in finches was found to give rise to many fibers that did not descend through the pons and medulla as a compact bundle, but traveled caudally in more central and dorsal parts of the tegmen-tum. Although it was not possible to determine the specific sites of termination of these widely dispersed fibers, many of them probably ended in the lateral tegmentum, just as many fibers in the bundle of Bagley do in the goat. Thus, finches may have two components that resemble Bagleyâs bundle, one originating in the same cortical region as the pyramidal tract and terminating in the lateral tegmen-tum, as in the goat, and another originating in the archistriatum that terminates in parts of the spinal trigemi-nal nucleus, among many other regions of the brainstem Zeier and Karten, 1971 Wild and Farabaugh, 1996 Dubbeldam et al., 1997 . Another HA projection to what may be considered a sensory relay was to the intercollicular region ICo sur-rounding the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus ICc . This shell-like region is the nexus of several function-ally related projections, for in addition to the projections from HA, it receives distinct projections from 1 the dorsal column nuclei and cells in medial lamina V of the upper cervical spinal cord Leibler, 1975 Wild, 1989 Wild, 1995 Wild, 1997 present study 2 a region of the archistriatum intermedium Ai that in songbirds surrounds RA and is thought to comprise the ââauditory archistriatumââ Mello et al., 1998 but see Wild and Williams, 1999 , or from a medial region of Ai in non-songbirds Wild et al., 1993 Mello et al., 1998 present study 3 large cells in the caudal and medial parts of the paleostriatum primitivum, cells that may in turn receive their input, via the paleostria-tum augmentatum, from audiosomatic regions of the caudomedial neostriatum, such as parts of the Field L complex and nucleus interface NIf Wild et al., 1993 present study and 4 the medial and lateral hypothala-mus Berk, 1987 Berk and Butler, 1981 present study . In both songbirds and non-songbirds e.g., Columbiformes , neurons in parts of ICo that surround the ICc, including the caudomedial nucleus of the torus semicircularis and the core nucleus of the superficial preisthmic area a specialized somatosensory nucleus identified in pigeons see Wild, 1995 , project rostrally and terminate in or close to nucleus ovoidalis, the principal auditory nucleus of the thalamus Leibler, 1975 Schneider, 1991 Durand et al., 1992 present study . These afferent and efferent projec-tions of the intercollicular region surrounding ICc support the idea of its being a site of audiosomatic convergence and processing, distinctly reminiscent of the shell-like region that surrounds parts of the inferior colliculus in mammals and includes the external and dorsal nuclei Huffman and Henson, 1990 Wild, 1995 . Moreover, the fact that the ICc itself receives projections from the dorsal column nuclei Wild, 1995 Wild, 1997 , the fact that nucleus ovoidalis Ov can also be partioned into ââcoreââ and ââshellââ regions based on their cytoarchitecture and their differential pro-jections to the caudal telencephalon Wild et al., 1993 Vates et al., 1996 , and the fact that the Ov shell receives the output of parts of the shell surrounding ICc, all suggest that audiosomatic convergence may be a constant feature at all levels of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in the avian brain, including some parts of the telencepha-lon to which Ov and its shell project Korzeniewska, 1987 Wild, 1995 Vates et al., 1996 . The most rostral of the sensory relay nuclei that receives a projection from HA is the principal somatosensory thalamic nucleus, DIVA. Only sparse terminations were observed in this nucleus, although in those cases in which the HAinjection also included parts of IHA, the presence of retrogradely labeled cells in DIVA could have obscured some of these terminations. These results complement those from studies of the efferent projections of the visual Wulst, which terminate in dorsal thalamic visual nuclei that provide the input to IHA Karten et al., 1973 Casini et al., 1992 . Minor projection to the ventral horn In addition to the majority of spinal terminations in the base of the dorsal horn at upper cervical levels, there were also some labeled fibers in the ventrolateral funiculus and a few terminations in the tip of the ventral horn where the motoneurons of various neck muscles are located Zijlstra and Dubbeldam, 1994 . Although direct projections from the pyramidal tract to spinal motoneuronal pools have often been regarded as present mainly in primates Kuypers, 1981 , they have more recently also been found in rats Liang et al., 1991 . The fact that they are also present in birds may seem at variance with the idea of their being related to manual dexterity, but the birdâs neck is an extraordinarily mobile device for placing the head and beak in grasping and manipulative positions. From a functional point of view, therefore, the birdâs neck can be seen as analogous to the arm and wrist of higher primates and may, therefore, be under partial direct ââcorticalââ control. Shiga et al. 1988 suggested that early-developing reticulospinal and possibly other bulbospinal axons that travel in the lateral funiculus make monosynaptic contacts with the dendrites of spinal motoneurons in chicks, but the possibility that pyramidal tract fibers contribute to such contacts should perhaps now be considered. Relation of inputs to outputs in HA In summary, HA of the rostral Wulst seems likely to be significantly involved in the control of somatosensory input at several levels of the neuraxis. HA probably gains access to primary somatosensory information via the thalamic projection of DIVA to IHA Wild, 1987, 1997 , in an analogous manner to the way in which HA at more caudal levels gains access to visual information derived from the projections of the principal optic nuclei of the thalamus to IHA of the visual Wulst Karten et al., 1973 Shimizu et al., 1995 . It should be noted, however, that although the projections of DIVA are concentrated in IHA, they are not confined to this lamina, but extend medially to a lesser extent into HA itself Wild, 1997 and unpublished observations in zebra finches , a fact that could suggest some direct input onto descending projection neurons. Further detailed work is required to clarify the path of information transfer through the laminae of the avian Wulst see also Shimizu et al., 1995 . Whether the rostral Wulst also has a significant role in motor control remains to be determined, although the substantial projections of HAto the red nucleus, the region of the subcoeruleus ventralis, and to extensive regions of the lateral medulla may all contribute to such a role. The possible effects of lesions to HA on movements or posture have not been investigated, but subtle rather than dra-matic effects will require careful assessment. Overall, the extratelencephalic projections of the rostral Wulst of passe-rine birds resemble components of the pyramidal tract in mammals that originate from both parietal and frontal cortices, in that they descend to innervate both the various precerebellar and sensory relay nuclei and brainstem nuclei possibly involved in motor control. In birds, how-ever, the cells of origin of the pyramidal-like projections to the various extratelencephalic sensory relay and premotor nuclei appear to a large extent to be intermixed in rostral HA, but they overlap only to a certain extent with the cells of origin of the intratelencephalic projections Wild and Williams, 1999 . Whether HAcells collateralize to different targets remains to be assessed. HA-hypothalamic connection The reciprocal connections of rostral HA with the stra-tum cellulare externum are discussed last because the hypothalamus is not usually considered in the same context as the targets of the pyramidal tract. The present findings in finches confirm similar findings of a projection of TSM to the posterolateral hypothalamus in the mallard duck Dubbeldam, 1976 , but a rationale for this connec-tion is lacking. In mammals, parts of the prefrontal cortex, particularly its medial, lateral, and orbitofrontal parts, have connections with the hypothalamus, including its posterolateral nuclei e.g., Takagishi and Chiba, 1991 Morecraft et al., 1992 Hardy, 1994 Buchanan et al., 1994 Kunzle and Lotter, 1996 Ongur et al., 1998 . A ââprefrontal cortexââ has been postulated for the avian brain e.g., Divac et al., 1994 , but this is located much more caudally in the posterodorsolateral telencephalon and does not originate any extratelencephalic projections. An alternative sugges-tion might be that an avian prefrontal analogue to the mammalian prefrontal cortex, if there is one at all, is likely to lie anterior to a somatosensory somatomotor area, as in mammals. In reality, this is impossible in the passerine brain, because the somatosensory somatomotor area is already situated at the rostral pole of the brain, but perhaps the rostral HA incorporates several different kinds of neurons, some of which are more closely related to the hypothalamus than they are to the pyramidal tract.An important caveat to this suggestion, however, is that there is currently no evidence, either from the present or any other study, that the rostral HA receives a projection from any thalamic nucleus that may be considered the avian version of a mediodorsal nucleus MD Veenman et al., 1997 . Apart from DIVA, the only thalamic nucleus identi-fied in the present study as a possible source of afferents to rostral HAwas the nucleus subrotundus SRt , the nucleus claimed by Medina et al. 1997 not to project to the rostral Wulst in pigeons. This discrepancy may be due not to a species difference, but to the fact that the injections in the rostral Wulst made in the study by Medina et al. 1997 were in the dorsal part of HA, whereas the rostral Wulst injections in the present study were made in deep HA. However, the fact remains that SRt is not considered comparable with MD in mammals Veenman et al., 1997 . Further speculation about the specific meaning of the hypothalamic connection is unwarranted at the present time. From a broader perspective, however, it can be noted that both telencephalic regions that send long descending projections as far as the lower brainstem, viz HA and the archistriatum, also send projections to the hypothalamus, that from the archistriatum to the medial hypothalamus and that from HA to more lateral parts of the hypothala-mus and to the periaqueductal gray Zeier and Karten, 1971 present study . Like the archistriatum, therefore, HA may be capable of exerting control over visceral autonomic and somatosensorimotor components of behavior. RESULTS Efferent projections In the three zebra finches that received a BDA injection at a dorsal location in rostral HA, few labeled fibers were found caudal to the diencephalon. In contrast, in all the cases that received injections of either BDA or CTB in more ventral parts of rostral HA, the projections were much more extensive, and it is these that are described below. Irrespective of their size, these more ventral injec-tions were largely confined to HAand IHAby the boundary created by the latter and by the lamina frontalis suprema, which forms the lateral border of IHA Figs. 1â4 . How-ever, in cases receiving large injections, a variable amount of spread of tracer from the ventrally and rostrally placed injections extended dorsally and caudally into rostral parts of the visual Wulst. Consequently, in addition to the labeling of rostral Wulst efferents, there was in these cases some labeling of efferents originating in the visual Wulst, which was indicated by the presence of terminal fields in visually related nuclei in the diencephalon and mesen-cephalon, e.g., the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, some of the pretectal nuclei, the optic tectum predominantly laminae 13 and 4 , and the dorsal cap of the nucleus of the basal optic root. In cases receiving smaller injections in ventral HA that did not encroach on the visual Wulst, these projections to visual nuclei, which have been well described in other avian species Adamo, 1967 Karten et al., 1973 Bravo and Pettigrew, 1981 Rio et al., 1983 Miceli et al., 1987 Casini et al., 1992 , were not observed, and in the present report they will be further referred to only in passing. Efferent fibers collected in the lateral part of the septo-mesencephalic tract TSM , which coursed down the me-dial aspect of the hemisphere. On entry to the diencepha-lon, the tract formed two rami, as previously described e.g., Huber and Crosby, 1929 Rio et al., 1983 . The dorsal ramus TSMd Fig. 4 was located dorsal to the optic tract and dorsolateral to the rostral pole of the nucleus rotun-dus. Although not generally appreciated, it carries fibers destined for nonvisual and visually related nuclei. The ventral ramus TSMv Fig. 4 was initially located on the medial side of the lateral forebrain bundle, but finally emerged ventral to the quintofrontal tract to run caudally through the base of the hypothalamus Fig. 1Ab . In the dorsal thalamus, sparse terminations were observed in the nucleus dorsalis intermedius ventralis anterior DIVA , which supplies the somatosensory projection to IHA of the rostral Wulst see Fig. 13d . These terminations were supplied by fibers that entered DIVA from above, via TSMd. Diffuse terminations were also observed in dorsal regions of the stratum cellulare externum SCE of the posterolateral hypothalamus, these terminations becom-ing more dense in the cell-poor region dorsal to the nucleus of the basal optic root nBOR Fig. 5 . In the caudal dorsal diencephalon, a dense terminal field was present in the rostrodorsal parts of the medial spiriform nucleus SpM Figs. 1c 6b 7b,d . In passerifomes, these parts form medial and lateral ââwings,ââ the latter extending to the lateral roof of the diencephalon and being located immedi-ately ventral to rostral levels of the nucleus uvaeformis Uva Wild, 1994 Fig. 7A . Labeled fibers were seen to access SpM from the overlying TSMd, but it is possible that some terminations were also supplied by dorsally directed fibers of TSMv. Ventral and ventromedial to SpM, dense terminations were also present throughout the caudal part of nucleus principalis precommissuralis, the prerubral field and the medial part of the mesencephalic reticular formation Figs. 1c 2b 3b . In transverse sec-tions, labeled fibers were seen to extend medially from SpM to the central periaqueductal gray GCt , which received a diffuse terminal field Fig. 7c , and ventromedi-ally to the red nucleus Ru , which received a dense projection, particularly to its ventrolateral part Figs. 3b,e 6c,d . Projections to this ventrolateral part extended ven-trally on the lateral aspect of the ventral area of Tsai, in which sparse terminations were also observed. Termina-tions in SpM, GCt, and Ru were predominantly ipsilateral, but sparse projections crossed the midline in the vicinity of the nucleus innervated to terminate in the homologous nucleus on the contralateral side. Caudal to SpM a laterally directed contingent of fibers headed into the intercollicular region where it surrounded the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus ICc, also known as the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsal or MLd Fig. 8c . Terminations were apparent all around the border of the ICc but were particularly dense lateral to it, i.e., in the external nucleus of the IC Ex , and medial to ICc. As indicated in a green finch that received an injection of CTB into the dorsal column nuclei and an injection of BDA in the contralateral rostral HA, the BDA labeled projections here overlapped the mesencencephalic terminations of the medial lemniscus, particularly at the medial border of ICc not shown . A few fibers crossed in the posterior commissure to enter the contralateral inter-collicular region. As TSM left the mesencephalon to enter the pons, part of it formed a distinct tract at the base of the brain, ventral to the medial lemniscus, which at these levels is beginning to send fibers dorsolaterally toward the inferior colliculus Wild, 1987 Wild, 1997 present study . This part of TSM continued in this sublemniscal position at the base of the brain throughout the remainder of the pons and upper medulla, but many other TSM fibers passed caudally in more central and dorsal regions of the pontine and medul-lary tegmentum Fig. 2A,c,d . Some fibers even swept up into the brachium conjunctivum to enter the cerebellum, but because of the special and unusual nature of this projection, it will be further described in a separate report Wild and Williams, unpublished observations . The ven-trally situated tract was largely the caudal continuation of TSMv, but the more diffuse brainstem projections could have been derived from either or both rami. At caudal mesencephalic and rostral pontine levels, there was an extensive and diffuse projection to the ipsilateral ventrolateral tegmentum, including the lateral mesencephalic reticular formation, the subcoeruleus ven-tralis, and the region ventral to the trigeminal motor nucleus Figs. 8b,d 9A . There were also distinct projec-tions to a region medial to the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus PrV Fig. 9b , but no significant terminations were observed within this nucleus. Slightly more caudally, there was a discrete terminal field overlying cells embed-ded in the dorsal aspect of the exiting facial nerve not shown . This field was not related to the large neurons of the lateral vestibular nucleus, which overlies the facial and vestibular nerve roots, but to smaller neurons resem-bling those of the superior vestibular nucleus. Sparse terminations were also observed in the medial vestibular nucleus. Throughout the base of the pons, a localized projection was given off from the ventral ramus to the dorsal cap of the medial pontine nucleus Figs. 3c 9A,c , and in the base of the medulla terminations were observed in the ventral lamella of the inferior olivary nucleus Fig. 2A,c . Many fibers that were not part of the discrete ventral ramus at the base of the brain passed through lateral parts of the caudal pons and rostral medulla in a widely dis-persed and extensive array, and it was not possible to ascertain their specific terminations with any certainty Figs. 1d 2c,d . However, there was a distinct projection to the lateral part of the tegmentum, immediately ventral to the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve. More cau-dally in the medulla, the projections to this subtrigeminal region became much more pronounced, being fed by fibers leaving the ventral ramus Fig. 10A,b . These fibers coursed dorsally up the lateral aspect of the medulla, giving off terminations to the subtrigeminal region and to the exter-nal cuneate nucleus as they did so. They skirted the pars caudalis of the nucleus of the descending trigeminal tract, gave extensive terminations to the cuneate and gracile nuclei, particularly to their more ventral parts, and then crossed though the commissura infima to terminate even more densely in all the same nuclei on the opposite side Fig. 10 . A few fibers left the ventral ramus and crossed the midline through the base of the medulla to add their projections to the contralateral dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei. Fibers entered the cervical spinal cord to descend, predominantly ipsilaterally, in the medial aspect of the lateral funiculus and through the base of the dorsal horn of both sides Figs. 3d 11a . The greatest density of termina- tions occurred contralateral to the HA injection in more medial aspects of the base of the dorsal horn, although some terminations were also apparent in the central part of the gray matter, dorsal to the central canal Fig. 11b,c . Other fibers descended in ventral parts of the ipsilateral lateral funiculus Fig. 11a,d and gave rise to sparse terminations in the tip of the ventral horn on the same side. Fibers could be followed to about the level of C6 or C7, and no fibers or terminations were observed within the brachial or lumbosacral enlargements. Retrograde confirmation of the specific sites of origin of the HA projections All injections in putative target nuclei resulted in retro-grade labeling of cells that were confined to rostral HA, but there was no obvious indication of a topographic organiza-tion of the origins of the projections, i.e., cells labeled from injections in different nuclei were intermixed in HA. All injections except those in the medulla labeled HA cells predominantly ipsilaterally. The injections in the dorsal and lateral medulla labeled cells in deeper regions of rostral HA, with a slight contralateral predominance Fig. 12A . That the injections included the dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei was indicated by the fact that medial lemniscus was anterogradely labeled Wild, 1997 . Medial mesencephalic injections retrogradely labeled cells throughout rostral HA and cells in the deep cerebellar and dorsal column nuclei that project to the red nucleus Wild, 1989 Wild, 1992 Arends and Zeigler, 1991 . The injections in SpM were centered on the nucleus, as indicated by extensive anterograde labeling of the mossy fiber projec-tion to the cerebellum Karten and Finger, 1976 Wild, 1992 , but none of them were confined to the nucleus, each having some involvement of the adjacent pretectal nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells were distributed throughout the entire dorsoventral extent of HA, but they did not extend to the most lateral part of the lamina Fig. 12B . The injection in the hypothalamus labeled many neurons throughout rostral HA, some of them contralaterally, although they were concentrated in more ventral regions of the lamina Fig. 12C . Because of the proximity of the injection to fascicles of TSMv, however, uptake by fibers of passage cannot be ruled out in this case. The injection in ICo depicted in Figure 12E was centered at a somatosen-sory locus medial to ICc and labeled neurons in deep regions of rostral HA Figs. 12D, 13a . It also produced the following pattern of retrograde labeling that is typical of injections located anywhere in the shell of neurons sur-rounding ICc MLd . Labeled neurons were distributed throughout this shell bilaterally, indicating extensive inter-connections between its various parts Fig. 12E . Retro-gradely labeled neurons were also present in the dorsal column nuclei Fig. 10f , medial lamina V of the upper few cervical spinal segments see Wild, 1995 , the caudomedial part of the paleostriatum primitivum Fig. 13b see also Wild et al., 1993 , the medial and lateral hypothalamus, and a region that surrounds the robust nucleus of the archistriatum Fig. 13c . The ICo injection also produced a shell of anterograde labeling around the thalamic auditory nucleus ovoidalis, bilaterally but predominantly ipsilater- ally Fig. 13d . The relation of this labeling to cells in DIVA that were retrogradely labeled by an injection of BDA in the rostral HA of the same case is also shown in Figure 13d. Retrogradely labeled cells resulting from HA injections Several groups of intratelencephalic and extratelence-phalic neurons were labeled as a result of the HA injec-tions, but only the latter are noted here. One was the nucleus dorsalis intermedius ventralis anterior DIVA , the principal somatosensory nucleus of the dorsal thala-mus Fig. 13d see also Wild, 1987 Wild, 1997 . DIVA was labeled predominantly ipsilaterally, but a few labeled DIVA neurons were located slightly more rostrally on the contralateral side. Other retrogradely labeled cells were located in 1 nucleus subrotundus, a nucleus that appears to have projections to widespread regions of the telencepha-lon 2 the same part of the stratum cellulare externum SCE of the hypothalamus that received the anterograde projections from HA 3 the base of the ipsilateral pontine tegmentum, just dorsal to the descending ventral ramus and 4 the medial edge of the red nucleus. Nothing is known about the last two projections. In cases with large injections, a few lightly labeled neurons were also found in the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior thalami, pars lateralis, which projects to the visual Wulst e.g., Karten et al., 1973 Nixdorf and Bischoff, 1982 .

Neurol. 416 451â460, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Physiological and anatomic studies in the 1940s re-vealed unusual reflexes that bypass the central nervous system Kuntz and van Buskirk, 1941 Kuntz and Sacco-manno, 1944 . These reflexes originate in the alimentary canal and pass back to the same or more proximal regions of the digestive tract by way of the abdominal prevertebral ganglia. The reflexes can be elicited by distension of the colon and by distension or chemical stimuli applied intralu-minally in the small intestine for review see Szurszewski and Miller, 1994 . Early studies demonstrated that these intestinointestinal reflexes persist after decentralisation of the prevertebral ganglia, although the threshold for activating the reflexes is increased by decentralisation Kuntz and Saccomanno, 1944 Semba, 1954 Shapiro and Woodward, 1959 . Since then, electrophysiological studies have shown that the cell bodies of sympathetic postganglionic neurons in prevertebral ganglia receive a prominent excitatory nico-tinic synaptic input from axons arising in the viscera Crowcroft et al., 1971 Szurszewski and Weems, 1976 Kreulen and Szurszewski, 1979 . Retrograde tracing stud-ies demonstrated that the peripheral inputs to the prever- tebral ganglia originate from neurons with cell bodies in the myenteric plexus intestinofugal neurons of all re-gions of the gastrointestinal tract Kuramoto and Furness, 1989 Furness et al., 1990 Messenger and Furness, 1991, 1992, 1993 Parr et al., 1993 Mann et al., 1995 . The extent to which intestinofugal neurons are directly responsive to distension of the colon or are stimulated indirectly after activation of colonic intrinsic primary afferent neurons IPANs is uncertain. Many physiological studies have addressed this question without achieving a complete answer Crowcroft et al., 1971 Weems and Szurszewski, 1978 Bywater, 1993 Parkman et al., 1993 Stebbing and Bornstein, 1993 Miller and Szurszewski, 1997 . For these studies, preparations of intestine and connected prevertebral ganglia were set up in divided organ baths. By separately superfusing the segment of gut or the ganglia, comparisons were made of the responses of intestinofugal neurons to distension of the wall of the gut before and after synaptic transmission in the gut segment was blocked by nicotinic antagonists or low calcium-containing saline. These studies suggested that 1 intesti-nofugal neurons receive synaptic input from other enteric neurons that are excited by distension, and 2 intestinofu-gal neurons also detect distension of the gut. Thus, it appears that some or all intestinofugal neurons receive synaptic input from other enteric neurons, and some or all intestinofugal neurons are also directly distension sensi-tive. It is possible that there are two populations of intestinofugal neurons, one that is directly sensitive to distension and one that is activated by inputs from other enteric neurons Szurszewski and Miller, 1994 Sharkey et al., 1998 . Sharkey et al. 1998 directly investigated whether intestinofugal neurons receive synaptic input from other enteric neurons by recording intracellularly from retro-gradely labelled intestinofugal neurons that project from the distal colon to the inferior mesenteric ganglia IMG of the guinea pig. Fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials fast EPSPs were recorded in all intestinofugal neurons in response to stimulation of internodal strands and some intestinofugal neurons received on-going spontaneous fast EPSPs. The morphologies of the intestinofugal neurons were revealed by intracellular injection of biocytin by means of the recording electrode. None of the neurons from which recordings were made had Dogiel type II morphol-ogy, which is the morphology of the IPANs of the guinea pig small intestine, nor did intestinofugal neurons exhibit the electrophysiological behaviour characteristic of the IPANs that respond to stretch of the small intestine of the guinea pig Kunze et al., 1998, 1999 . In the present study, we have used a combination of retrograde neuronal tracing with Fast Blue, immunohistochemistry, and surgical inter-ruption of nerve pathways to identify sources of synaptic input to intestinofugal neurons of the distal colon. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrograde labelling of intestinofugal neurons All experimental procedures were in accordance with the guidelines for animal welfare set out by the National Health and Medical Research Council ofAustralia. Experi-ments were performed on 17 male guinea pigs, each weighing between 200 and 325g, from the University of Melbourne colony. The procedure for injection of the retro- grade neuronal tracer, Fast Blue, was identical for all guinea pigs and is summarised below. Each animal was anaesthetized by subcutaneous injection of sodium pento-barbitone 15 mg kg Boehringer-Ingelheim, New South Wales, Australia 1 hour before the operation and an intramuscular injection of a mixture of fentanyl citrate 0.16 mg kg and droperidol 8.0 mg kg 15 minutes before the operation. The abdomen was opened by a midline incision and the IMG was exposed by exteriorising and retracting the small and large intestines. Fast Blue Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO was dissolved in 10% dimeth-ylsulphoxide DMSO in distilled water at 2% weight volume and injected into both lobes of the IMG by using a bevelled glass micropipette of 60â80 Î¼m.An average of two injections into each lobe rostral and caudal was used total volume, 1â3 Î¼l . After injection of the IMG, and return of the intestines to the body cavity, the peritoneum and abdominal muscles were sutured and covered with an antibiotic powder, cicatrin Wellcome, New South Wales, Australia and the skin was stapled together. Each animal received a 0.1 ml intramuscular injection of terramycin 50 mg ml Pfizer Agricare, New South Wales, Australia , a broad spectrum antibiotic. Surgical interruption of nerve pathways Seven to 12 days after Fast Blue was injected into the IMG of 10 animals, operations were carried out to surgi-cally ablate specific nerve pathways. In four animals, two myotomies, separated by 15â70 mm, were performed. In this procedure, the animals were anaesthetised and opened in the same manner as before and a pair of parallel circumferential cuts were made through the external musculature of the distal colon, thus severing the nerve pathways in the myenteric plexus Messenger and Fur-ness, 1990 . A loose loop of surgical thread was tied around the nearest mesenteric blood vessel to mark each opera-tion site. Extrinsic denervations were performed on four animals. The lumbar colonic nerves were located and severed as they emerged from the IMG, denervating the distal colon of sympathetic input and of those sensory fibers that follow the sympathetic nerves. The surrounding mesentery was also cut and, to ensure that no fibers in close proximity to the inferior mesenteric artery remained intact, the artery was lightly swabbed with cotton wool soaked in 80% phenol. The site of the operation was marked by a small piece of surgical thread to enable identification in dissection. The two remaining animals underwent combined double myotomy plus extrinsic dener-vation operations. After these operations, the animals were left for a further 6â10 days to allow degeneration of the axons that were severed. Once enough time was allowed for the Fast Blue to fill intestinofugal neurons as completely as possible 7â12 days and the axonal ablations to take effect a further 6â10 days , animals were stunned by a blow to the back of the head, then killed by severing the carotid arteries and the spinal cord. In the animals without myotomies, a 5-to 8-cm-long segment of the distal colon adjacent to the IMG was removed as a control. Segments of colon were im-mersed in phosphate-buffered saline PBS 0.9% NaCl in 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 containing the muscle relaxant nicardipine 3 Î¼M, Sigma . The segment of colon was then cut along the antimesenteric border, as most of the intestinofugal neurons lie close to the mesen- teric attachment Kuramoto and Furness, 1989 Messen-ger and Furness, 1993 , and fecal pellets were removed. To visualise intestinofugal neurons better, the mesen-tery was carefully removed and the tissue pinned tautly on balsa board. The tissue was then fixed by immersion in 2% formaldehyde plus 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at 4Â°C overnight and subse-quently cleared in DMSO 3 3 10 minute changes fol-lowed by PBS 3 3 10 minute changes . The mucosa, submucosa, and circular muscle were removed, leaving myenteric plexus and longitudinal muscle whole-mount preparations. Immunohistochemistry Whole-mount preparations of longitudinal muscle with attached myenteric plexus were incubated for 30 minutes in 10% normal horse serum in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, to limit background staining, before exposure to primary antisera. Excess serum was then removed, and the prepa-rations were incubated in mixtures of primary antibodies for 2 nights at room temperature in a humidified chamber Table 1 . Cell body staining was also carried out on whole-mount preparations of longitudinal muscle plus myenteric plexus of guinea pig distal colon that had been incubated in culture medium containing colchicine under sterile conditions for 24 hours before fixation Messenger and Furness, 1990 . After incubation at room temperature in combinations of primary antisera, tissue was washed in PBS and then incubated for 2 hours in a mixture of secondary antibodies see Table 2 comprising one antibody linked to biotin and one directly labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC . The tissue was then washed for 30 minutes in PBS and incubated with streptavidin-Texas Red for 90 minutes. A final wash in PBS was made before tissue was mounted in glycerol buffered with 0.5 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 8.6 . Preparations were examined on a ZeissAxioplan fluores-cence microscope Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany equipped with the appropriate filter cubes for discriminat-ing between Fast Blue, FITC, and Texas Red fluorescence. Preparations were scanned carefully by using the filter cube to reveal Fast Blue fluorescence. Each successively located Fast Blue-labelled neuron was examined by switch-ing the filter cube to reveal fluorescence for one of the immunohistochemical markers of synaptic terminals within the myenteric plexus. The fluorescence observed for these immunohistochemical markers, along with the Fast Blue fluorescence of the intestinofugal neurons, was cap-tured by using a Sensys 12-bit cooled CCD camera Photo-metrics, Ltd., Tucson AZ and V for Windows imaging software Digital Optics, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand . Contrast and sensitivity adjustment were carried out by using Corel Photopaint imaging software Corel Corpora-tion, Dublin, Ireland . Some preparations were examined by using a confocal scanning laser microscope system BioRad MRC 1024 attached to a Zeiss Axioplan fluores-cence microscope . The laser was an argon krypton mixed gas laser with excitation and emission wavelengths 448 and 522 535 nm, respectively, for FITC and 568 and 605 632 nm for Texas Red. Samples were scanned sequen-tially to collect light emitted as red or green fluorescence by using a 1003 oil immersion objective and 31.4 zoom. Optical sections of 0.5 Î¼m thickness were taken in each case. Images of 768 3 512 pixels were obtained and processed by using Confocal Assistant and Corel Photo-paint. Retrogradely labelled neurons were evaluated under the microscope and in the stored images, to determine whether they were surrounded by pericellular baskets of immuno-histochemically labelled nerve terminals. To do this, we followed the criteria of Pompolo and Furness 1995 for the identification of baskets. Pericellular baskets consist of closely spaced axonal varicosities that are juxtaposed to cell bodies. They are at a greater density around inner-vated cells than in the neuropil, or in relation to uninner-vated cells, and ultrastructural examination shows that varicosities in baskets form synapses on the cell bodies that they surround Pompolo and Furness 1995 Mann et al., 1997 . DISCUSSION Sources of innervation We have found that the cell bodies of intestinofugal neurons that project to the inferior mesenteric ganglia from the distal colon are surrounded by cholinergic nerve terminals. The possible sources of these terminals are intrinsic neurons, extrinsic neurons whose axons reach the colon by means of the mesenteric nerves, vagal axons that take an intramural course to reach the colon and branches of the pelvic nerves that run orally within the gut wall intramural pelvic nerves see Furness and Costa, 1987 . None of the extrinsic sources seem to contribute signifi-cantly. When the mesenteric nerves were severed and their endings allowed to degenerate, there was no detectable loss of innervation of the cell bodies of intestinofugal neurons. Moreover, in the region between two circumferen-tial myotomies, which would sever both vagal fibers de-scending within the gut wall and ascending fibers from the pelvic nerves, normal innervation persisted in ganglia toward the anal part of the neurally isolated segment. The appearance was the same if the two myotomies and the mesenteric nerve section were performed together. Thus, the pericellular fibers at the distal part of the segment between myotomies must arise from neurons with cell bodies within the neurally isolated segment, and, because the loss of nerve terminals occurred at the oral part of this segment only, the neurons must be anally projecting. However, not all fibers were lost from the oral region. The remaining fibers are, therefore, of local origin, either from cell bodies in myenteric ganglia or from cell bodies in submucosal ganglia. The lack of detectable loss of innerva-tion oral to circumferential lesions of intramural nerve pathways indicates that ascending fibers do not contribute significantly to the innervation of the cell bodies of intesti-nofugal neurons. We have identified the class of cholinergic descending interneuron that makes a large contribution to the cholin-ergic innervation of intestinofugal neurons. VAChT, VIP, and bombesin all labelled nerve terminals that surround the majority of intestinofugal neurons. Moreover, by exam- ining the cell bodies of myenteric neurons in preparations of distal colon that had been pretreated with colchicine, a class of descending interneurons was identified that was immunoreactive for ChAT, VIP, and bombesin. In studies on the myenteric plexus of guinea pig distal colon that used single label immunohistochemistry, descending inter-neurons with immunoreactivity for VIP, NOS, and bombe-sin have been identified Messenger and Furness 1990 McConalogue and Furness, 1993 present results . Bombe-sin VIP-IR terminals also surrounded many other nerve cells, including other bombesin-IR neurons, but there were cells without this innervation thus, these descending interneurons evidently make specific connections with intestinofugal neurons, descending interneurons, and other classes of neurons, which, by analogy with the small intestine, probably include inhibitory motor neurons Kunze and Furness, 1999 . Relations of labelled nerve terminals to nerve cell bodies The inputs to the intestinofugal neurons have been examined by fluorescence microscopy. Dense baskets of cholinergic VAChT-IR varicosities were closely apposed to the nerve cells. Electrophysiological studies support the conclusion that the baskets of VAChT-IR varicosities repre-sent true synapses, because fast EPSPs were recorded from the intestinofugal neurons, and, although this was tested in only a few cases, the fast EPSPs were blocked by an antagonist of cholinergic transmission, hexametho-nium Sharkey et al., 1998 . Similar associations of bas-kets of terminals have been examined by electron micros-copy, and in all cases, many of the varicosities were found to form true synapses showing presynaptic accumulations of vesicles and synaptic densities , whereas some varicosi-ties formed close contacts closely apposed membranes, presynaptic accumulations of vesicles but no discernible synaptic densities . The presence of synapses within bas-kets of immunoreactive terminals in enteric ganglia has been confirmed by electron microscopy and includes calreti-nin-IR inputs to calretinin-IR interneurons Pompolo and Furness, 1993 , somatostatin-IR inputs to somatosta-tin-IR interneurons Portbury et al., 1995 Pompolo and Furness, 1998 , NOS-IR inputs to VIP-IR secretomotor neurons Li et al., 1995 , bombesin-IR inputs to calreti-nin-IR motor neurons Pompolo and Furness, 1995 , NOS-IR inputs to NOS-IR motor neurons Young et al., 1995 , 5-HT-IR inputs to 5-HT-IR interneurons Young and Furness, 1995 , and somatostatin-IR inputs to NOS-IR cell bodies Mann et al., 1997 . The numbers of varicosities seen in apposition to nerve cells with fluorescence immunohistochemical methods is likely to be an overestimate of the number of true synaptic inputs Mann et al., 1997 . This is because some of the varicosities are separated from the surfaces of nerve cells by glial cell processes. Physiological significance Bywater 1993 made the interesting observation that when synaptic transmission within the colon was blocked, the initial response of intestinofugal neurons to distension was not significantly reduced, whereas the response after 10â15 seconds of sustained distension was almost abol-ished. This finding suggests that reflexes that pass from the gut by means of intestinofugal neurons to the preverte-bral ganglia have two components one that is a direct response of intestinofugal neurons to distension and the other that is a response to synaptic input from other enteric neurons to intestinofugal neurons i.e., intestinofu-gal neurons are indirectly activated by the distension stimulus . Szurszewski and Miller 1994 have suggested that intestinofugal neurons may form a homogenous popu-lation of neurons that are both directly and indirectly activated. Evidence in support of this theory was provided by Sharkey et al. 1998 , who found that all intestinofugal neurons from which intracellular membrane potential recordings were taken had S-type electrophysiological characteristics and had Dogiel type I morphology in other words, they appear to form a homogenous population. Experimental evidence also suggests that all intestinofu-gal neurons have the same primary transmitter, acetylcho-line Szurszweski and Miller, 1994 Mann et al., 1995 Sharkey et al., 1998 . The results of the present study support the idea that intestinofugal neurons are a popula-tion that is homogenous in its most significant characteris-tics. Ninety-three percent of intestinofugal neurons were surrounded by basket-like arrangements of VAChT-IR varicosities. It is not possible to say that the other 7% are not innervated by cholinergic nerve terminals because the VAChT-IR terminals may not always form a distinct pericellular basket and may also contact dendrites of intestinofugal neurons that are not revealed by Fast Blue fluorescence. On the other hand, we found that about 25% of the intestinofugal neurons were surrounded by calbin-din terminals. Calbindin is a marker of Dogiel type II neurons, which are presumed to be IPANs in the colon Lomax et al., 1999 but is also contained in other types of neuron. Thus, it is possible that a minority of intestinofu-gal neurons receive direct inputs from IPANs. There is strong experimental evidence that intestinofu-gal neurons are length sensors Szurszewski and Miller, 1994 , whereas there is good evidence that the IPANs of the ileum respond to tension generated in the external muscle in response to stretch rather than the stretch per se, i.e., they are tension detectors Kunze et al., 1998, 1999 . These IPANs have Dogiel type II morphology and AH electrophysiological characteristics Furness et al., 1998 . A recent study has revealed the neurons in the myenteric plexus of the guinea pig distal colon that have similar morphologic, immunohistochemical, and electro-physiological characteristics to the IPANs of the ileum Lomax et al., 1999 . The observations of Bywater 1993 might be accounted for if intestinofugal neurons respond to changes in length directly, which would account for the initial response to distension that persists after blockade of synaptic transmission within the gut. The slowly devel-oping increase in tension in response to this distension might excite the IPANs, but not the intestinofugal neurons directly. These IPANs then excite each other and provide input to the descending interneurons, which in turn provide fast synaptic input to the intestinofugal neurons. Convergence of fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials onto the intestinofugal neurons would cause action poten-tial firing in the intestinofugal neurons in response to distension by means of the increase in tension that would be sensitive to synaptic blockade. Neurons with similar chemical coding ChAT, VIP, bombesin, NOS to the class of descending interneuron that provides cholinergic input to intestinofugal neurons in the distal colon have been examined in the guinea pig small intestine. Anatomic and pharmacologic studies indi-cate that this class of interneuron forms descending chains and that these neurons innervate the inhibitory motor neurons that relax the circular muscle Young et al., 1995 Yuan et al., 1995 Kunze and Furness, 1999 , i.e., they are conduits of local descending reflex pathways in the small intestine. It is likely that similar descending interneurons in the distal colon that innervate the intestinofugal neu-rons are also involved in local intrinsic reflex pathways in the colon because, as discussed above, they innervate other nerve cells in the myenteric ganglia. This raises the interesting possibility that the sustained response to dis-tension that is observed in intestinofugal neurons is controlled by the same class of descending interneuron that is involved in local descending inhibitory reflexes in the gut. RESULTS Injection of Fast Blue into the IMG resulted in labelling of neuronal perikarya in the myenteric plexus of the distal colon. The staining of these neurons was usually restricted to the cytoplasm, although occasional nuclear staining was also observed. The shapes of neurons were not as well defined as in previous studies, in which tissue was gener-ally taken after 4â10 days. In the present work, 13â22 days elapsed, so that there was time for retrograde accumu-lation before nerves were severed, and then time for degeneration of the severed fibers. In this time, much of the Fast Blue relocated to lysosomes away from the cell surface and dendrites e.g., Fig. 1 . Retrogradely labelled nerve cells were distributed around the circumference of the colon, although they were more numerous at the mesenteric aspect of the gut, as previously reported Fur-ness et al., 1990 . Neurons whose shapes were revealed fell into two reasonably distinct morphologic groups. The first group had many short lamellar dendrites, whereas the second group had one or more lamellar dendrites but also had up to five longer dendritic processes that had distinct irregularities on their surfaces. Both cell types correspond to the class of neurons designated by Dogiel 1899 as type I see Sharkey et al., 1998 . Preparations of longitudinal muscle plus myenteric plexus containing Fast Blue labelled intestinofugal neu-rons were stained with a variety of immunohistochemical markers of nerve terminals of populations of myenteric neurons. Fast Blue-labelled nerve cell bodies were com-monly surrounded by immunoreactive IR varicosities which outlined cell bodies, sometimes forming several layers of varicosities Fig. 1A,A8 . Such relationships be-tween varicosities and cell bodies, described as pericellular baskets, have been examined by electron microscopy, and it had been found that varicosities within these baskets form synapses with the cell bodies Pompolo and Furness, 1995 . One hundred ninety-nine of 215 nerve cell bodies 93% were surrounded by basket-like arrangements of axon varicosities that were immunoreactive for the vesicu-lar acetylcholine transporter VAChT , which is a marker of cholinergic nerve terminals Fig. 1A,A8,B,B8 . The cell bodies of intestinofugal neurons were also examined for their relation to vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP -IR and bombesin-IR terminals in preparations stained for VAChT plus VIP or bombesin plus VIP. One hundred sixty-nine of 212 intestinofugal neurons 80% were sur-rounded by VIP-IR varicosities, whereas 77 of 88 intesti-nofugal neurons 88% examined were surrounded by bombesin-IR terminals Fig. 1B,B88,C,C88 . These double-staining experiments showed that terminals that were immunoreactive for each of these markers formed baskets around intestinofugal neurons and that these markers were commonly colocalised within individual varicosities Fig. 1B8,B88,C8,C8 . Varicose terminals with bombesin-IR were found around other nerve cells, but some nerve cells were not sur-rounded by bombesin-IR varicosities. Bombesin-IR varicosi-ties surrounded most bombesin-IR nerve cells Fig. 3A,B . Descending inputs Myotomy and extrinsic denervation operations were performed to identify the projection patterns of cholinergic neurons that innervate intestinofugal neurons. In prepara-tions from the animals in which myotomy operations were performed, there was a decrease in the innervation of intestinofugal neurons in the 10 mm on the anal sides of the lesions and quantitative data presented below on the effects of myotomy operations was obtained from the first 10 mm anal or oral to a myotomy. There was a dramatic reduction in the number of intestinofugal neurons that were surrounded by VAChT-IR and VIP-IR varicosities just anal to a myotomy operation i.e., where the axons of neurons with descending oral to anal projections had been severed and allowed to degenerate . In untreated animals, 93% of intestinofugal neurons examined were surrounded by VAChT-IR terminals see above , whereas after a myotomy operation performed oral to the area examined 37 of 141 intestinofugal neurons 26% had VAChT innervation that was similar to controls a further 40 of 141 intestinofugal neurons 28% had few VAChT-IR terminals close to them, insufficient to be recognised as a pericellular basket Fig. 2B,B8 , and the remaining 64 neurons 46% had no VAChT-IR terminals close to the cell bodies. In areas just anal to a myotomy, 10 of 87 12% intestinofugal neurons had normal innervation by VIP-IR terminals a further 18 of 87 20% had reduced innerva-tion and 59 of 87 68% had no close VIP-IR terminals Fig. 2C,C8 . The innervation of intestinofugal neurons by VIP-IR varicosities returned to normal about 10 mm anal to the myotomy operation site. This finding is consistent with the findings of Messenger and Furness 1990 , who reported that VIP fibers in myenteric ganglia in the guinea pig colon were reduced by oral myotomy operations but that normal VIP innervation of myenteric ganglia was observed within approximately 8 mm anal to the site of the myotomy. Ascending inputs The effects of myotomy operations that interrupt ascend-ing fibers within the myenteric plexus on the innervation of intestinofugal neurons by VAChT-IR terminals were examined. In the 10 mm oral to myotomies, 51 of 60 intestinofugal neurons 85% had normal VAChT innerva-tion, suggesting that ascending pathways do not contrib-ute significantly to the innervation of intestinofugal neu-rons by cholinergic terminals Fig. 2A,A8 . Extrinsic inputs Extrinsic denervation operations were performed to determine the contribution of extrinsic neurons to the innervation of intestinofugal neurons, and immunohisto-chemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase TH was used to monitor the effectiveness of the denervation. In prepara-tions from unoperated animals, TH-IR fibers formed a dense network within myenteric ganglia, whereas after extrinsic denervation, only rare TH-IR fibers could be seen, consistent with previous findings Furness, 1970 . In segments of colon that had been extrinsically denervated, 36 of 43 intestinofugal neurons 84% received normal VAChT innervation. In the two animals that had under-gone both extrinsic denervation and myotomy operations, there was a reduction in VAChT innervation anal to the myotomies that recovered at about 1 cm anal as described above, but further anal between the myotomy operations no reduction was observed. These results, along with the finding of only infrequent innervation of intestinofugal neurons by TH-IR fibers in untreated preparations 5 of 36 14%, Table 3 suggest that the innervation of intesti-nofugal neurons originates predominantly within the gut wall. Because VAChT, VIP, and bombesin were localised in many terminals that surrounded intestinofugal neurons, we investigated whether there were myenteric nerve cell bodies with the appropriate neurochemistry to be a source of the terminals. Staining of myenteric neurons of the guinea pig distal colon that had been pretreated with colchicine to enhance cell body immunoreactivity for pep-tides revealed that choline acetyltransferase ChAT , VIP, bombesin, and nitric oxide synthase NOS immunoreactivi-ties are colocalised in a subset of nerve cells Fig. 3 . Many of these nerve cells were surrounded by bombesin-IR terminals. Sixty-six of 100 bombesin-IR myenteric nerve cell bodies were ChAT-IR, 50 of 56 bombesin-IR were VIP-IR, and 78 of 79 were NOS-IR. We also examined whether intestinofugal neurons had terminals surrounding them that were immunoreactive for neurochemical markers of subclasses of myenteric neurons other than VAChT, VIP, and bombesin Table 3 . No other markers stained terminals that surrounded such a large proportion of intestinofugal neurons. A complica-tion that made accurate counting of the number of intesti-nofugal neurons that were surrounded by varicosities immunoreactive for a particular substance was that the cell bodies of intestinofugal neurons are immunoreactive for NOS, bombesin, VIP, calretinin, calbindin, and ChAT Furness et al., 1990 Mann et al., 1995 . This was not a problem with bombesin and VIP, because cell body stain-ing of myenteric neurons with these markers is weak without colchicine treatment, whereas cell body staining of intestinofugal neurons with calbindin, calretinin, and NOS is intense and precludes accurate assessment of whether cell bodies of intestinofugal neurons are sur-rounded by terminals immunoreactive for these markers. To determine the proportion of intestinofugal neurons with inputs from calbindin-, calretinin-, or NOS-IR terminals, only retrogradely labelled nerve cell bodies that did not have the same immunohistochemistry were examined. Of the intestinofugal neurons whose cell bodies were not immunoreactive for calretinin, calbindin or NOS, 6 of 47 13% were surrounded by calretinin-IR terminals, 7 of 30 23% by calbindin-IR terminals, and 15 of 69 23% by NOS-IR terminals respectively Table 3 .

Several decades of work have established that a limited set of brain regions form a neural network necessary for the mediation of maternal behavior. The components of this network have been examined most frequently in the parturi-ent female during the postpartum maintenance of maternal behavior, but work also has been done in the brain after the pup-sensitized, nonhormonal onset of the behavior. The parturient adult female rat typically exhibits prompt and robust maternal behavior toward her newborn pups. She builds a compact nest retrieves the pups to the nest and groups them, crouches over them in the nest, licks them with particular attention to the anogenital region, and exhibits maternal aggression to intruders Rosenblatt and Lehrman, 1963 . Adult rats, other than naturally parturient females, for example, virgin females, and also males are capable of exhibiting maternal behavior toward pups provided from foster dams. Continuous exposure to newborn pups in an experimental paradigm referred to as sensitization, induces maternal behavior in these mater-nally naÄ± Â¨ve adult females and males. Rosenblatt, 1967 Bridges et al., 1974 Mayer et al., 1979 Mayer and Rosenblatt, 1979 Brunelli et al., 1985 Stern, 1987 Stern and Rogers, 1988 Pellegrini and Dessi-Fulgheri, 1994 . Because gonadectomized males and females or gonadecto-mized and hypophysectomized females can be sensitized to become maternal by pup-exposure, it is believed that sensitization does not require either steroid or pituitary hormones Rosenblatt, 1967 . The behavioral role of many of the components of the neural circuit that support maternal behavior was studied initially in the parturient lactating female subsequent work has examined other models and has provided some overarching conclusions about the specific functions of the various components of the neural circuit. Certain behavior-ally relevant components of this neural circuit are neces-sary for maternal behavior, which is expressed in each of the models mentioned above, whereas other components have a more limited function in one aspect of the behavior Corodimas et al., 1993 Matthews-Felton et al., 1995 Numan, 1994 . The medial preoptic area MPO is necessary for all types of maternal behavior, including its hormonally driven onset and maintenance Numan, 1974 Numan et al., 1988 Cohn and Gerall, 1989 . Furthermore, neurons within the MPO are necessary for the pup-mediated, nonhormonal onset of maternal behavior in maternally naÄ± Â¨ve, adult, virgin, female rats and male adult rats Numan et al., 1977 Gray and Brooks, 1984 Rosenblatt et al., 1996 , and they are needed for pup-mediated maternal behavior in juvenile rats Kalinichev et al., 1997, 1999 Natterer and Fleming, 1997 Olazabal et al., 1999 . An area immediately adjacent to the MPO, the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis BSTv , apparently is necessary independently for maternal behavior, because selective excitotoxin-induced lesions of this region also severely impair the maintenance of maternal behavior in lactating rats Numan and Numan, 1996 . The neural basis of maternal behavior in sensitized females also closely resembles that of postpartum females, and the neural underpinnings of sensitized maternal behavior certainly include the MPO and the BST. How-ever, because sensitized females, unlike parturient fe-males, need to overcome their timidity neophobia and their aversion to pup odors during their prolonged expo-sure to pups before they can respond maternally to them i.e., retrieve pups, lick them, crouch over them as in nursing, and build a nest around them , additional neural sites mediating these behaviors were studied. In delineat-ing the neural basis for the onset of maternal behavior in nonpregnant females, the main and accessory olfactory systems and their central projections in the pyriform cortex and the amygdala corticomedial and medial nuclei were studied in greater detail than in postpartum females. Once these structures were found to be important in sensitized females, they also were studied in postparturi-ent females performing maternal behavior. For example, the cortical amygdaloid COA and medial amygdaloid MEA amygdaloid play an important role in the onset of pup-mediated maternal behavior in adult rats. These areas, which process olfactory and vomeronasal informa-tion Krettek and Price, 1978 , appear to mediate aversive responses toward pups, as exhibited by naÄ± Â¨ve, adult ani-mals, and appear to inhibit maternal behavior during the initial period of pup exposure. Lesions of the COA and MEA significantly shorten the duration of pup exposure necessary to stimulate maternal behavior in nulliparous female rats Fleming et al., 1980 Numan et al., 1993 . However, in contrast to the MPO and BSTv, these amygda-loid nuclei may not be necessary for the maintenance of maternal behavior in postpartum, lactating female rats Slotnick, 1969 . Our laboratory has demonstrated that neurons of the lateral habenula LH are necessary for the onset of maternal behavior in the parturient female Corodimas et al., 1993 Matthews-Felton et al., 1995 but not for the maintenance of the behavior during the postpartum period Corodimas et al., 1992 . In addition, the LH also is necessary for the pup-mediated, nonhormonal onset of maternal behavior in adult female rats Matthews-Felton et al., 1998 . Thus, we have concluded that the onset of maternal behavior in the adult, regardless of how it is initiated, relies on a neural circuit that includes the LH as a required component. Additional areas in the forebrain and midbrain are necessary for the maintenance of maternal behavior or its components in the postpartum dam but do not appear to be involved significantly in the onset of maternal behavior. These include the lateral preoptic area LPO , the adjoin-ing substantia innominata SI , the septum Fleischer and Slotnick, 1978 Flannelly et al., 1986 Numan et al., 1988 , the ventral tegmental area VTA or the regions caudal to it Gaffori and LeMoal, 1979 Numan and Smith, 1984 Numan and Numan, 1991 , and the periaquaductal gray PAG Lonstein and Stern, 1997a,b . Dopaminergic neuro-nal somata of the VTA may participate in this ventral midbrain loop of the neural circuit that supports maternal behaviors, because neurotoxic lesion of the dopaminergic components of the VTA or the nucleus accumbens NA disrupts retrieval in postpartum dams Hansen et al., 1991 Hansen, 1994 . The lateral and ventrolateral aspects of the periaqueductal gray PAGc at an intercollicular level specifically mediate the upright crouching kyphotic posture prominent in lactating female rats during the postpartum period Lonstein and Stern, 1997a . This is a specific effect, because other components of the behavior, such as retrieval, licking, and even total nursing time, were unaffected by these lesions. Maternal behavior can be induced in juvenile rats e.g., 27 days old by continuous exposure to pups such mater-nal behavior is robust and is similar qualitatively to adult maternal behavior Mayer and Rosenblatt, 1979 Gray and Chesley, 1984 . Moreover, at slightly earlier ages days 18â22 , juvenile rats lack an initial aversive reactions to pups, are even more eager to engage in contact with newborns, and exhibit shorter latencies for maternal behav-ior than maternally naÄ± Â¨ve, adult animals Bridges et al., 1974 Stern, 1987 Stern and Rogers, 1988 . Their mater-nal behavior resembles that of adult females with allow-ances for their size and strength they drag pups to the nest during retrieving instead of carrying them, and their crouching is less fully developed. Juvenile rats are not unique in their ability to exhibit maternal behavior. Juveniles of many mammalian species, including humans and other primates and most species of rodents, exhibit well-organized maternal behavior quite similar to that of adults Beniest, 1958 Rowell, 1961 Epple, 1975 Owens, 1975 Rheingold et al., 1976 Estrada and Sandoval, 1977 Zahn-Waxler et al., 1983 Ostermeyer and Elwood, 1984 . Furthermore, this behavior can be distinguished from play behaviors Gray and Chesley, 1984 . The phenomenon of juvenile maternal behavior has stimulated questions about the neural substrate that supports the behavior in the younger animals compared with the neural circuit that supports the adult behavior. These comparisons may provide insight into the neural substrate that supports the nonhormonal onset of mater-nal behavior and into the basic elements of the circuit that may be present at its earliest stages. Because both juve-niles and adults can be sensitized into a maternal state, this enables us to compare the sites of neural sites in sensitized juveniles and adults during the performance of maternal behavior to determine whether these are similar or different to any significant extent. Similarities would indicate an early development of the mediation of mater-nal behavior by these neural sites, whereas differences would indicate that the neural mediation of maternal behavior undergoes significant development between pre-puberty and adulthood. Brain regions that are important for the pup-stimulated i.e., sensitized onset of maternal behavior in adults may be particularly useful in hypothesizing which brain areas are involved in the sensitization of juveniles to a maternal state. However, based on our data on the differential effects of MPO lesions in juveniles versus adults, we hypothesize that the components of the neural circuit that support maternal behavior in juveniles also may have some notable differences from those in the adult. Whether altogether different components of the neural circuit are involved, whether the relative importance of each compo-nent within the circuit is different, or whether given components function differently is entirely unknown. We already have evidence that the latter is the case specifically with respect to the MPO mediation of maternal behavior Kalinichev et al., 1997, 1999 . Neurotoxic lesions N-methyl-D-aspartic acid of the MPO that produce se-vere deficits in all components of maternal behavior in adults produce deficits only in retrieving and nest building in juveniles and leave crouching behavior unimpaired. Moreover, large MPO lesions 72% volume are required to produce these deficits in juveniles, whereas much smaller lesions 6.7% volume produce the more complete impair-ment of maternal behavior seen in adults. Small MPO lesions 5.4% volume produce no deficits in maternal behavior in juveniles. We wanted to use a method that would provide an overview of the activation of the brain in the juvenile rats that were maternal therefore, we turned to the induction of immediate early-genes IEGs , which have been em-ployed as markers of neuronal populations that are acti-vated in maternal adult rats. The working hypothesis was that neurons in which there is selective induction of c-fos IEG, which is correlated in a tight temporal manner with the performance of maternal behavior, are neurons that are part of the neural circuit that mediates maternal behavior. This working hypothesis was the organizing principle for a substantial pool of data. Together, these data show that, in the adult, the MPO, LPO, BSTv, lateral septum LS , NA, LH, MEA, COA, and PAGc have signifi-cantly more neurons that express c-Fos immunoreactivity in maternal animals than in nonmaternal controls Cala-mandrei and Keverne, 1994 Fleming and Walsh, 1994 Fleming et al., 1994 Kirkpatrick et al., 1994 Numan and Numan, 1994, 1995, 1997 Fleming and Korsmit, 1996 Lonstein and Stern, 1997a,b Lonstein et al., 1998 Numan et al., 1998 . For each of these areas, data from the induction of c-fos IEG are in strong accord with data gathered from experiments that were obtained by using a lesion-based approach. Amore direct proof of the behavioral role of the IEG fosB has been attempted by using mice that have been altered genetically to delete the fosB gene Brown et al., 1996 . These mice have severe deficits in postpartum maternal behavior, but they exhibit no sensory, cognitive, or neuroen-docrine abnormalities. Brown et al. posited that the nurtur-ing deficit in fosB mutant mice is due to the absence of FosB protein within the MPO and not due to some secondary effect based on other gross deficits. Whether this deficit in FosB is functionally critical during development or adulthood remains to be determined. The hypothesis that FosB is important for maternal behavior is supported further by a correlation between increased numbers of FosB-immunoreactive -Ir cells within the MPO of geneti-cally normal wild-type mice exhibiting maternal behav-ior compared with their appropriate, genetically normal wild-type , nonmaternal controls Brown et al., 1996 . In further accord with these data, postpartum, lactating, female rats exhibiting maternal behavior also have signifi-cant increases in the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO and BSTv Numan et al., 1998 compared with appropriate, nonmaternal controls. The goal of the current study was to determine which forebrain regions participate in the neural circuit that supports maternal behavior in juvenile rats. We used the immunocytochemical detection of c-fos and fosB IEG pro-tein products as tools to identify neuronal populations involved in maternal behavior of 27-day-old juvenile rats and 60-day-old adult rats. We studied females at both ages in which maternal behavior was established by sensitiza-tion using the criterion of the performance of maternal behavior in two consecutive tests. After overnight separa-tion from the pups, these maternal, sensitized females were then reexposed to pups for 2 hours, during which they exhibited full maternal behavior before they were killed. Females that were exposed to pups for the same sensitiza-tion period but that did not exhibit maternal behavior were examined as controls. These females were separated further into two types of controls those that were provided with pups until they were killed and those that were isolated for the 2 hours before they were killed that is, after an overnight separation, these control, nonmaternal females either were provided with pups for 2 hours or were not reexposed to pups at all . A limited amount of work has been done on the compo-nents of the neural circuit that are necessary for the expression of maternal behavior in juveniles Fleming et al., 1994 Kalinichev et al., 1997, 1999 . In fact, there is direct evidence only for the role of the MPO and amygdala in juvenile maternal behavior. We also considered that the components of the neural circuit important for the sensi-tized form of the onset of maternal behavior in adults might be components of the neural circuit that support maternal behavior in juveniles. These forebrain regions are the MPO, BST, COA, MEA, and LH, and they formed our first priorities for an examination of brain regions important in juvenile behavior. For comparison, we also examined several forebrain regions that are not involved in maternal behavior Numan, 1994 Matthews-Felton et al., 1995 but are capable of expressing Fos immunoreactiv-ity in relation to different stimuli. These control regions are the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus ARH , the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus VMH , and the medial habenula MH . Our data from experiments with the lesion method indicate that there also are some differences in the function-ing of components of the neural circuit that supports juvenile versus adult maternal behavior. Therefore, we also examined the same forebrain regions in adult females that were induced into maternal behavior with the same pup-exposure paradigm to provide an appropriate compari-son between the report on Fos in maternal participation in juveniles and adults. Due to the labor intensity of the methods, particularly the analytic endpoints for the induction of Fos, we choose to examine the effects of pup reexposure on the subjects at a single time-point. We based our choice of a 2-hour time point on the only evidence available on the induction of c-fos in the case of pup-stimulated maternal behavior that of the induction of this behavior in the adult. According to Numan and Numan 1994 , in these pup-sensitized adult females, the number of Fos-Ir neurons in the MPO and BSTv was highest at the 2-hour time point compared with 1-hour and 3-hour time points after the reexposure of the subjects to the foster pups. Because we were interested in the comparison of c-fos and fosB expression in both juve-niles and adultsâa four-way comparisonâit naturally was necessary that all groups be assessed after a 2-hour reexposure to pups. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental animals The subjects were female rats ages 27 days and 60 days on the first day of the behavioral experiments. All subjects were obtained by breeding female rats Sprague-Dawley originally purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA in the colony maintained in our facility of Laboratory Animal Services, Rutgers University, Newark Campus, which is an American Association for Accredita-tion of Laboratory Animal Care-facility. Animals were weaned at the age of 21 days and then housed as all-female litters of four per cage. Seven or eight days before the behavioral experiment commenced, the adult females were ovariectomized under metofane Pitman-Moore, Washing-ton Crossing, NJ anesthesia. The subjects were kept on a reversed 12-hour light-dark cycle, with lights off at 0700 hours. Food and water were provided ad libitum. An additional group of adult females were mated to provide foster pups for maternal behavior testing. The donor females and their litters were kept on a normal 12-hour light-dark cycle, with lights off at 1900 hours. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Behavioral protocols To establish maternal behavior, the experimental sub-jects were exposed continuously to foster pups. The foster pups were exchanged daily for freshly fed foster pups that had been cared for by the parturient females in the colony that had produced them. This is a well-established proce-dure in our laboratory that stimulates maternal behavior in the experimental subjects. This process is referred to as maternal sensitization Rosenblatt, 1967 . Once maternal behavior was established in the experimental subject, it was isolated from all foster pups overnight and reexposed to freshly fed foster pups for 2 hours to stimulate the expression of maternal behavior and, presumably, to in-duce the expression of IEGs. Our pilot data indicated that females exposed to either three or six pups continuously have similar latencies for the onset of maternal behavior. For practical reasons, therefore, we decided to establish maternal behavior with continuous exposure to three pups. However, in the final phase of the experiment, that is, the final 2-hour pup exposure period, we reexposed the experimental subjects to six pups. This was to ensure maximal stimulation of maternal behavior. Sensitizing exposure to foster pups commenced when experimental animals were either 27 days old juveniles or 60 days old adults . Fourteen hours before the subjects first were exposed to foster pups, they were transferred to clear Plexiglas observation cages that contained wood shavings Beta-chip Northeastern Products, Warrens-burg, NY and two shredded paper towels as nesting material. The following morning, three freshly fed pups ages 1â5 days were introduced to these home-observation cages and placed in the corner diagonally opposite from the subjectâs nest and sleeping corner. Daily observations for maternal behavior were performed according to the stan-dard protocol established in the laboratory and consisted of examining pup-retrieval, pup-carrying, crouching, and pup-licking behaviors Rosenblatt, 1967 Fleming and Rosenblatt, 1974a,b Rosenblatt et al., 1979, 1996 . After each daily observation period, pups were left with the experimental animals continuously until the next morn-ing. Then, observations were recorded on the position of the pups with respect to the test animal, and the nest was scored. Subsequently, the pups were exchanged for freshly nursed foster pups provided by parturient females from the colony, and the next observation period for maternal behavior was initiated. Maternal behavior was considered to be fully estab-lished when all three pups were retrieved and grouped in the nest within the first 15 minutes of daily testing on 2 consecutive days Rosenblatt, 1967 Numan et al., 1977 Rosenblatt et al., 1996 . Experimental animals were ex-posed to pups for 3â6 days, until such time that they met this criterion for maternal animals. Nonmaternal animals that were exposed to pups but did not become maternal were then matched with the animals that became mater-nal, and the final phase of the experiment was undertaken. Finally, after the sensitization process established mater-nal behavior, the test subjects were isolated from all foster pups overnight. The next morning, they were reexposed to six pups for 2 hours and observed continuously for the first 30 minutes and at 30-minute intervals until they were killed. Pilot data indicated that, on being reunited with pups, the females display maternal behavior most in-tensely during the first 20 minutes. At the end of the 2-hour period of pup reexposure, the rats were anesthe-tized and then perfused. Two control groups also were prepared for both the juveniles and the adults. Both groups consisted of animals that had been exposed to pups for the same number of days as the animals that became maternal, but these were animals that had failed to become maternal during the daily testing. In the first control group, nonmaternal rats were treated exactly as the maternal rats described above that is, first, they were isolated from pups overnight. Then, the next morning, they were exposed to six foster pups for a 2-hour period. During these 2 hours, they were observed continuously for the first 30 minutes and then at 30-minute intervals until perfusion. These nonmaternal fe-males, as expected, did not exhibit retrieval behavior toward pups during the entire 2-hour reexposure period. The second group of nonmaternal, control animals dif-fered in their experimental treatment from the two groups described above, in that they were not reexposed to pups after their overnight isolation from them. The following morning, at the beginning of a 2-hour period that would involve reexposure to pups for the other two groups, this group had their cage-lids removed and their bedding displaced, but no pups were placed in the cage. At the end of the 2-hour period, the rats were perfused. At the end of the testing period, the groups consisted of the following numbers of individual rats 1 subjects that were maternal, and were reexposed to pups after overnight separation juveniles, n 5 8 adults, n 5 7 2 subjects that were never maternal but were reexposed to pups after an overnight separation nonmaternal pups juveniles, n 5 8 adults, n 5 7 3 subjects that were never maternal and were not reexposed to pups after the overnight separation nonma-ternal isolated juveniles, n 5 6 adults, n 5 6 . Tissue preparation and immunocytochemical processing Deeply anesthetized animals Nembutal 65 mg 200â350 gm body weight this is a deliberate overdose were in-jected with 0.2 ml of heparin 1,000 units ml in the left ventricle of the heart and then perfused with 100 ml of cold 25 mM phosphate-buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4, followed by 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were removed from the skulls, blocked, and postfixed in fixative overnight at 4Â°C, then transferred to 15% sucrose in 25 mM PBS solution at 4Â°C until the brains sank overnight . Frozen sections 50-Î¼m-thick were cut with the aid of a sliding microtome, collected in an ethylene-glycol-based cryoprotectant solution Watson et al., 1986 , and stored at 220Â°C until immunocytochemical processing. Immunocytochemical procedures were performed accord-ing to the protocols established by our laboratory DonCar-los et al., 1991 Wagner et al., 1996 . Tissue was removed from the freezer, allowed to equilibrate to room tempera-ture for 1 hour, and then rinsed in five changes of 25 mM PBS, pH 7.2â7.4. Nonspecific binding of the antibody was blocked by placing the tissue in 4% normal goat serum Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA diluted in 0.3% Triton X-100 25 mM PBS, pH 7.2â7.4, for 1 hour. Brain sections were exposed to the primary antibody at 4Â°C for 42 hours. The primary antibodies were either anti-c-Fos antibody 1 1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody Ab-5 Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY or anti-FosB-N antibody against the common amino-terminal region of FosB and delta-FosB 1 600 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody Nakabeppu and Nathans, 1991 Nakabeppu et al., 1993 Doucet et al., 1996 . Each antibody was diluted in a 1% solution of normal goat serum in 25 mM PBS, pH 7.2â7.4. After four 10-minute rinses in 25 mM PBS, the brain tissue was floated for 1 hour in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1 600 in 1% of normal goat serum 25 mM PBS pH 7.2â7.4. Brain sections were rinsed four times for 10 minutes each in 25 mM PBS and placed for 1 hour in avidin-biotin complex ABC reagent from an ABC Elite kit Vector Laboratories that was mixed according to kit instructions. Next, the tissue was subjected to two 10-minute rinses in 25 mM PBS and two 10-minute rinses in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, initial pH 6.0. The final reaction was carried out with diaminoben-zidine DAB 0.035% and nickel-ammonium sulfate DAB-Ni 2.5% for intensification of the DAB reaction product dissolved in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer do not adjust pH of final solution it is acceptable between pH 6.0 and pH 7.2 .After 1.5 minutes, the reaction was stopped by rinsing the tissue in acetate buffer for two 10-minute periods followed by two 10-minute rinses in 25 mM PBS. Brain sections were mounted on chrome alum-coated slides, air dried overnight, dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol dilutions, cleared in Hemo-De Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ , and coverslipped with Permount Fisher Scien-tific . To control for and assess the variability across immuno-cytochemical runs, brain sections from at least three animals under each experimental condition were pro-cessed simultaneously in each run. We carried out the process so that empirical evaluation of the interreaction variability would be possible subsequently. This was done by processing sections from the same two animals in at least two different immunocytochemical runs. Methodological experiments to determine optimal immunocytochemical conditions The optimal reaction conditions for immunocytochemi-cal detection of the fos products in these animals using these particular antibodies were established empirically prior to processing sections from the experimental groups for comparison. Our goals were to 1 have low background and high immunocytochemical signal per neuron to insure that detection of false-positive results would be unlikely 2 to provide the basis for the identification of all neurons that contained the protein of interest and not some arbitrary subset determined by the limits of the method and 3 to detect even small changes in the number of neurons that expressed c-Fos or FosB immunoreactivity. We systematically varied the concentration of primary or secondary antibodies as well as the final reaction time in the chromagen solution. The primary antibody for c-Fos was diluted 1 100, 1 500, or 1 1,000 in 25 mM PBS, pH 7.2â7.4. Two dilutions of the secondary antibody, 1 200 or 1 600, were used with each dilution condition of this primary antibody, and the final reaction time in the chromagen solution was either 1.5 minutes or 3 minutes with every combination of primary and secondary anti-body dilution. The primary antibody for FosB was diluted 1 250, 1 500, or 1 1,000 with PBS. A 1 200 dilution of the secondary antibody was used with each concentration of the primary antibody, and the final reaction time in the chromogen solution was either 1.5 minutes or 3 minutes with every condition. Further details of the tissue prepara-tion and the immunocytochemical processing are de-scribed above. Some brain sections from all 22 juvenile animals were used for these experiments. Brain sections from every animal were distributed in each reaction condition, such that at least one section from every animal was used in each reaction condition. Analysis of immunoreactive neurons Analysis was conducted by using the methods from our previously published work Wagner and Morrell, 1996 Wagner et al., 1998 along with several advances in technology and recent understanding of proper quantita-tive approaches Bolender et al., 1991 Coggeshall, 1992 , as recommended by the editorial policy of this journal. We use the terms c-Fos-Ir to indicate all c-fos gene products identified by the antibody and FosB-Ir to indicate both fosB gene products, i.e., the full-length protein FosB and delta-FosB, that can be identified by this antibody. Criterion for neurons that expressed immunoreactive protein. A cell was considered labeled, that is, expressed either c-Fos or FosB protein, first as judged by eye with the aide of a Zeiss microscope Zeiss, Thornwood, NY . The nuclei of these neurons were black dark purple from the DAB-Ni reaction product and were substantially darker than the background. Next, we applied densitometry methods to measure precisely the density of a labeled cell so that we could use this definition with our automated analysis system. The criterion for whether a neuron was labeled was deter-mined by measuring the optical density of neurons and comparing it with the optical density of the background, using the Zeiss microscope connected to an imaging device, the MCID image-analysis system St. Catharines, On-tario, Canada for automated densitometry and cell count-ing. Those neurons that were identified by eye as labeled also had an optical density of DAB-Ni reaction product in their nuclei approximately three times darker than the optical density of the adjacent neuropil surrounding back-ground the labeled neuron. This criterion made the inclu-sion of false-positive cells extremely unlikely. We employed periodic spot checks of the automated system and found that our counts of immunoreactive neurons by eye and by using the MCID image-analysis system were virtually identical, but the automated system allowed substantially faster analysis of larger numbers of slides and large areas within the brain regions. the outlines of anatomic structures were made by using the low -power objective on a Zeiss microscope attached with a hardware interface to a computer equipped with the Neurolucida program MicroBrightField, Inc., Colchester, VT . Subsequently, we examined these same anatomic structures with a higher power objective to detect all labeled neurons. The Neurolucida program and hardware interface allows the exact plotting on a cell-by-cell basis of all labeled cells detected with a high-power objective. With this system, the labeled neurons can be detected with a high-power objective and mapped on the drawing of the actual section made with the low-power objective. The product of this analysis is a complete map of all of the immunoreactive neurons in their exact anatomic location with respect to each other and all other anatomic struc-tures. The resulting maps of the immunoreactive neurons are more complete than the picture provided by a low-power photomicrograph, because the limits to the resolu-tion that are naturally imposed by a photomicrograph taken with a low-power objective are avoided. We have figures of both representative maps made with the Neuro-lucida program of all c-Fos-Ir and FosB-Ir neurons in the brain regions of interest and low-power photomicrographs of two key sections for each antibody. Figures 3 and 14 were made by using the Neurolucida program, which resulted in maps of the number of immuno-reactive neurons that are precise quantitatively in all areas, including those represented with small dots. The atlas of Swanson 1992 was used for the anatomic identifi-cation and nomenclature. The atlas of Paxinos and Watson 1998 was used for some identification and for the figures, representing the anatomic levels with respect to Bregma. An additional series of Nissl-stained sections was used for an accurate identification of neuroanatomic regions. By using the Neurolucida system, it is possible to capture the image of one section, for example, a section that shows the immunoreactive neurons and also the Nissl section, so that very precise use can be made of the additional anatomic information from the Nissl. It also is true that most anatomic features were visible in the immunocyto-chemical preparation due to mild background staining. Five representative cross sections along the rostral-caudal axes of the preoptic area and the hypothalamus from the maternal adult animals were plotted systemati-cally for Fos-Ir neurons. All Fos-Ir neurons identified were represented in all anatomic areas shown on the drawings that is, we did not represent Fos-Ir neurons only in regions of interest to this study. A dot was made on the neuroana-tomic maps to represent each labeled neuron. Large, black dots were used for the areas that were analyzed quantita-tively. These were the areas associated with maternal behavior MPO, BST, MEA, COA, and LH. Several control sites that were not associated with maternal behavior, ARH, VMH, and MH, but were capable of expressing Fos immunoreactivity in relation to different stimuli also were analyzed quantitatively therefore, these sites are repre-sented by large dots on the maps. Small, gray dots were used for the areas that were not analyzed quantitatively in the subsequent analysis Quantitative analysis. We carried out the analysis of the number of immunoreactive neurons in two phases. First, we counted immunoreactive cells by eye to get a sense of the data and the scope of the analytic issues. We then conducted the majority of the analysis with an automated analysis system that we first verified empiri-cally and that provided us with data identical to the data collected by eye. It is important to note, however, that the automated analysis system allowed us to include more neuroanatomic regions and more of the area of these regions and to sample more sections quickly and effi-ciently. Initial phase of the quantitative analysis. Anatomically matched sections were counted with the aide of a Zeiss Axioplan microscope 340 objective lens, 310 ocular lens equipped with a grid placed in one ocular lens. This grid divided the visual field into 100 segments and allowed systematic counting across an anatomic subarea without the problem of double counting. With this method, we counted the immunoreactive neurons in the medial preop-tic nucleus MPN , the LH, and the MH. The numbers of labeled cells in the MPN were counted bilaterally at three anatomic levels of the MPN Bregma 20.40 mm, 20.60 mm, and 20.80 mm . This was carried out by superimpos-ing an ocular grid on a subregion of an MPN section and counting all labeled cells that were within the grid area. Thus, this was a sampling of a limited but constant anatomic area within the MPN. The numbers of labeled cells in the LH and MH were counted bilaterally at nine anatomic levels from Bregma 22.80 mm to Bregma 24.40 mm . Because there were fewer labeled cells in the LH and MH ,100 per side section , all of the labeled cells within the area were counted in each section. The relative num-bers of neurons in the LH and the MH all were counted by eye in the nine sections analyzed for this region. In a further phase of this analysis, the numbers of neurons in the LH were recounted by using state-of-the-art stereo-logic methods along with the appropriate technology for this purpose see below . This initial phase of the analysis allowed us to discover that there was a considerable and biologically interesting difference in the number of immunoreactive neurons across the experimental conditions. This analysis also provided the starting point for a more complete analysis of more anatomic areas and more sampling of these same anatomic areas in the second phases of the analysis. All data presented in the results were collected by using the automated analysis system after empirical verification that counts by eye and by the automated system were identical. tend our analysis efficiently, we measured the optical density of neuronal nuclei and compared it with the optical density of the background using the Zeiss Axioskop micro-scope connected to the MCID image-analysis system for automated densitometry and cell counting. The criterion for a labeled neuron is described above see Criterion for neurons that expressed immunoreactive protein . By using this image-analysis system, we counted labeled cells in the MPO, BSTv, BSTd, COA, MEA posteroventral MEA [MEApv] and posterodorsal MEA [MEApd] nuclei separately ,ARH, and VMH. The labeled cells in the MPO, BSTv, and BSTd were counted on four anatomic levels Bregma 20.20 mm, 20.40 mm, 20.60 mm, and 20.80 mm . The MPN also was analyzed separately on three anatomic levels Bregma 20.40 mm, 20.60 mm, and 20.80 mm . The COA and MEA were analyzed on two anatomic levels Bregma 2 2.80 mm and 23.00 mm and the ARH and VMH were analyzed on two anatomic levels Bregma 22.80 mm and 23.00 mm . For each section, all of the cells in each anatomic area were counted. Initial analysis, as expected, revealed similar numbers of labeled cells on the right and left sides of a brain section. Therefore, the majority of subsequent quantitative analy-ses were performed unilaterally, because we preferred to analyze more sections rather than both sides of the same section to get a better measure of the variation probably methodologically induced across the sections within a brain. Virtually all of the quantitative analyses were done with the automated system, i.e., with the Zeiss Axioskop microscope connected by a camera and hardware interface to a computer equipped with the MCID image-analysis system. Comparison proved that counting by eye and with the aid of the image-analysis system produced identical results. We also confirmed empirically that counting of labeled cells with the aid of the image-analysis system by using either a 310 objective or a 320 objective produces virtually identical results. The 310 objective was chosen for further analysis, because it covers a larger area. At the start of each analysis session, the image-analysis system was calibrated carefully. This process included setting predetermined settings on the microscope for the objective, light intensity, diaphragms, and condenser. To insure that the settings were correct and constant across all analyses and that the system was stable, at the start of each analysis session, we also measured the number and optical density of a specific population of neurons with Fos-Ir nuclei in several standard sections. The image-analysis system, as expected, counted the same number of labeled nuclei with each remeasuring of this standard population at the start of each analytic session. Also, the standard error for the measurement of optical density across these sets of measurements, which were taken over several months at the start of each analytic session, was ,2%. This process proved empirically, as we progressed throughout the extended analysis process, that our system was stable and was set at constant settings. Each session of analysis involved the counting of some sections from each of the experimental conditions, thus avoiding the situation where all sections from one experi-mental condition were analyzed during one or two sessions and then compared with sections from other experimental conditions analyzed at one or two different sessions. The analytical approach used in this study prevented double counting a single labeled cell, because sections analyzed were at least 200 Î¼m apart and, in areas counted by eye a grid in one ocular lens, acted as a visual field dissector. The image-analysis system used for automated counting is equipped with a feature that enables cells analyzed previ-ously to be identified, so that any chance of recounting a given cell was eliminated by its marking as counted on one of the monitors. Neuronal and cellular profiles in our 50-Î¼m sections are referred to as nuclei of neurons or cells. These terms retain the qualifications and limits of data in a two-dimensional analysis Bolender et al., 1991 Coggeshall, 1992 . There-fore, these data demonstrate the relative differences in the average number of c-Fos-Ir or FosB-Ir neurons across experimental groups in juvenile and adult animals. This analysis was not intended to present the total number of c-Fos-Ir or FosB-Ir neurons in the three-dimensional struc-tures that were analyzed. The data, both on the neuroana-tomic maps and in the table, present the actual counts of cells on the section sampled that is, raw data not derived by any approximations . With the aid of the image-analysis system, we have confirmed that the area of each neuronal nucleus expressing either c-Fos-or FosB immuno-reactivity does not change across experimental conditions or age groups. This is a necessary requirement for the analysis of the relative number of these neurons across different experimental conditions and is recommended by the editorial policy of this journal Bolender et al., 1991 Coggeshall, 1992 Wagner et al., 1998 . Stereological analysis of the habenula. In addition to the quantitative analysis described above, the LH was analyzed using stereologic methods West, 1993 Cogge-shall and Lekan, 1996 West et al., 1996 . The total number of Fos-Ir neurons in the LH was analyzed with the aid of computer program Stereoinvestigator MicroBrightField, Inc. with the methods used in the laboratory of Dr. Laszlo Zaborszky Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neurosci-ence, Rutgers University-Newark, NJ . Statistical analysis Bartlettâs test for the homogeneity of variance was applied before each analysis of any interval scale data. Because all interval scale data met the requirement for the homogeneity of variance, analysis of variance ANOVA factorial was used for the main effect. Fisherâs protected least significant difference PLSD post-hoc test was used for multiple, paired comparisons. Chi-square tests were used to compare the percentage data. The level of statisti-cal significance is P , 0.05. Data were analyzed using the StatView SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC statistical pack-age for the Macintosh computer Apple Computers, Cuper-tino, CA . Photomicrographs The higher power photomicrographs were taken as conventional black-and-white photographs using a Zeiss microscope equipped with a standard camera. The low-power photomicrographs are montages representing a significant portion of a single section in the preoptic area or medial basal hypothalamus. These montages were made by video capture of a high-power view of approxi-mately 6â12 fields from that single section that then were assembled to represent the portion of the hemisection in the figure. This montaging process was carried out by using a Nikon Eclipse E800 large research microscope Nikon, Tokyo, Japan equipped with a color-integrating digital video camera, which was interfaced with an Image Pro Plus capture and analysis system to Adobe Photoshop software Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA on a Gate-way computer. The final montage prints were printed from the Adobe Photoshop images on a Sony Digital Color Printer Marvigraph Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan . DISCUSSION This is the first study using the induction of IEGs to examine the forebrain regions that participate in the mediation of maternal behavior in the juvenile. Among the anatomic locations that we investigated, the LH is the only area in which maternal juveniles had significant increases in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactiv-ity compared with their nonmaternal controls. This effect was specific to c-Fos no increase in the number of neurons expressing FosB immunoreactivity was found in the LH. Although there was increased expression of c-fos or fosB in the neurons of the MPO, BSTv, BSTd, COA, and MEA in maternal adults, no such increased expression was found in any of these areas in maternal juveniles Table 2 . This suggests that there is a fundamental functional difference in the nature of the activity in the majority of the components of the neural circuit that supports maternal behavior in juveniles compared with adults. In addition to the new information on fos response in juveniles, our data from the adults have added to and extended the information available on the brain regions that report increased fos immunoreactivity in maternal adults. We found that the expression of maternal behavior was associated with significant increases in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity and FosB immunoreactivity in a limited number of brain regions that are known to be part of the neural circuit that mediates maternal behavior and not in regions outside this circuit. Our data are in good accord with previously published data showing such IEG-responsive neuronal populations in the MPO, BSTv, BSTp, COA, MEA, and LH in maternal adults. In many of these regions, we only observed an increase in the number c-Fos-Ir neurons. Although many studies have linked maternal behavior to the activation of c-Fos in neurons Calamandrei and Keverne, 1994 Fleming et al., 1994 Kirkpatrick et al., 1994 Numan and Numan, 1994, 1995, 1997 Fleming and Korsmit, 1996 Lonstein and Stern, 1997a,b Lonstein et al., 1998 Numan et al., 1998 , far fewer have examined the role of FosB Brown et al., 1996 Numan et al., 1998 . In addition, our report added to the information in the literature, because we examined quantitatively more ar-eas of the forebrain than previous studies. Furthermore, the majority of studies in the adult have used postpartum maternal behavior, which is a different model for eliciting maternal behavior than that used here, and they used animals that were generally $30 days older than the adults in our study Fleming and Walsh, 1994 Fleming et al., 1994 Numan and Numan, 1994, 1995, 1997 Fleming and Korsmit, 1996 Lonstein and Stern, 1997a,b Lonstein et al., 1998 Numan et al., 1998 . Time point Because our behavioral and neuroanatomic endpoints were very labor intensive, we chose only one time point after the reinitiation of maternal behavior at which to examine the stimulation of IEGs. We based our choice of a 2-hour time point on the only evidence available on the induction of c-fos in the case of pup-stimulated maternal behavior that of the induction of this behavior in the adult. According to Numan and Numan 1994 , in these pup-sensitized adult females, the number of Fos-Ir neu-rons in the MPO and BSTv was highest at the 2-hour time point compared with 1-hour and 3-hour time points after reexposure of the subjects to the foster pups. Also accord-ing to Numan et al. 1998 , by using a model of maternal behavior that examined its maintenance phase, the maxi-mal increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MPO and BSTv occurred after separation from pups followed by 2 hours of pup reexposure. Thus, we adopted Numanâs paradigm with the intention of demonstrating the maxi-mal increase in the expression of c-Fos. Reports on the stimulation of FosB are much sparser. Brown et al. 1996 reported stimulation of FosB in mice both 2 hours and 6 hours after the onset of active maternal behavior. In contrast, Numan et al. 1998 reported no increase in the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO and BSTv at their 2-hour time point, but did report a maximal expression of FosB after 6 hours of pup exposure. In the adults in our study, however, after 2 hours of pup exposure, there already were significant differences between mater-nal and nonmaternal adults in the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO and BSTv. Furthermore, in our study, after 2 hours of pup exposure, the relative increase ob-served in the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO and BSTv was greater than the increase detected by Numan et al. 1998 after 6 hours of stimulation. It should be pointed out that we used a different FosB antibody than Numan et al. and that there also were differences in our maternal model we used virgin females exhibiting maternal behav-ior as a result of sensitization paradigm, whereas Numan et al. studied lactating females on postpartum day 7 our adult rats were #30 days younger than their females, and they were gonadectomized before the pup exposure com-menced, i.e., not gonadally intact. How these factors influence the population of neurons that are recruited into activity in the maternal animal and report this activity with fos remains to be determined. Interpretation of IEG induction The IEG family has many members, including c-fos and fosB. These IEGs can be induced rapidly, but transiently, in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli Sheng and Greenberg, 1990 Morgan and Curran, 1991, 1995 . Pro-tein products of many IEGs, including c-fos and fosB, are transcription factors coupling second-messenger-mediated events with either induction or suppression of target genes. Sustained membrane depolarization and Ca21 in-flux result in the induction of c-fos Morgan and Curran, 1986, 1991 Doucet et al., 1990 Sheng et al., 1993 . Therefore, induction of c-fos and other IEGs has been viewed as a marker of neuronal activation Sagar et al., 1988 . However, membrane depolarization is not always required for the induction of IEGs. In some conditions, blockade of the sodium channels with tetrodotoxin does not prevent the induction of c-fos Koistinaho et al., 1993 Marshall et al., 1997 .Also, depending on which member of the jun family induces Fos complexes, it can either stimu-late or inhibit transcription of target genes Chiu et al., 1989 Schu Â¨tte et al., 1989 Sheng and Greenberg, 1990 . Therefore, it probably is more inclusive to interpret the induction of c-fos and other IEGs under particular stimu-lation as a marker for functional modification of neurons due to the changes in gene transcription Numan and Numan, 1995 . Antisense oligonucleotide targeting of specific peptides, including protein products of the IEGs, in discrete ana- tomic areas has proven to be a fruitful approach in relation to neuroendocrine and behavioral outcome Chiasson et al., 1992, 1997 Landgraf et al., 1997 Nicot and Pfaff, 1997 . A study by Moller et al. 1994 investigated the role of amygdaloid induction of c-fos in rats that were subjected to the Vogel conflict test. Administration of c-fos antisense oligonucleotide into the amygdala prior to testing attenu-ated the conflict-induced c-fos and decreased the level of anxiety presumably mediated by the amygdala Moller et al., 1994 . In another study Parsico et al., 1998 , a similar strategy was used to evaluate the role of c-Fos down-regulation in neurons of the prefrontal cortex after amphet-amine withdrawal. Injection of c-fos antisense oligonucleo-tide into the medial prefrontal cortex reduced the levels of c-Fos. Animals that received the injection exhibited a significant reduction in locomotor activity and repetitive movements when placed in a novel environment, mimick-ing behavioral alterations produced by amphetamine with-drawal. These findings suggest that c-fos and possibly other IEGs are involved not only in long-term days, weeks alterations in brain function but also may play a role in short-term minutes, hours neuronal functioning, expressed in a fairly rapid and particular behavioral outcome. When using the experimental approach of antisense technology, extensive control experiments are necessary to assess the specificity, possible toxicity, and mechanisms of action. Nevertheless, this technique can be useful tool to advance our understanding of the peptides that mediate maternal behavior. Recently, the antisense technique has been used successfully in relation to a maternal behavior paradigm Giovenardi et al., 1998 . Administration of an antisense oligonucleotide for oxytocin into the hypotha-lamic paraventricular nucleus increased maternal aggres-sion in lactating animals on the fifth day postpartum. Antisense oligonucleotides also could be used in future studies to alter the levels of c-fos or other IEGs, thus investigating, by direct intervention, the causal role of c-fos and fosB in maternal behavior of juvenile and adult rats. Our data would be important to the specific hypoth-eses that may be posed in these future experiments. For example, the correlation between the increased number of Fos-Ir neurons and maternal behavior enables us to predict that infusion of c-fos or fosB antisense into the MPO will have different effects on maternal behavior in juvenile and adult rats. Infusion of c-fos antisense will interfere with maternal behavior in adults and may have no effect on juvenile maternal behavior. In contrast, infu-sion of c-fos antisense into the LH may produce similar impairment of maternal behavior in juvenile and adult animals. Adults Among the anatomical regions that are known compo-nents of the neural circuit supporting pup-mediated expres-sion of maternal behavior in adults, different regions responded qualitatively and quantitatively differently in the expression of neuronal c-Fos-IR and FosB-Ir that correlated with maternal behavior Table 2 . For example, in the MPO and the BSTv of adults, the expression of maternal behavior was associated with increases in the number of neurons that expressed c-Fos immunoreactivity and neurons that expressed FosB immunoreactivity. In contrast, in the BSTd, COA, MEA, and LH, increases were found only in the number of neurons that expressed c-Fos immunoreactivity Table 2 . Neurons that express FosB, therefore, are involved in the mediation of maternal behavior only in particular components of its neural circuit. Regardless of the behavioral status of the animal or the age juvenile or adult , fewer neurons respond with FosB expression than with c-Fos expression in all brain regions. All of these FosB-responsive neurons were within a subregion of the neuroanatomical distribution of neurons that responded with increased numbers of c-Fos-Ir neu-rons. Taken together, these data imply that the neurons expressing FosB are involved in a specific, limited subset of the maternal functions and that the neurons expressing c-Fos are involved in a wider array of the maternal components. Comparing the anatomical distribution and the num-bers of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity and FosB immunoreactivity indicates that neurons expressing c-fos in the context of maternal responsiveness are an essentially distinct neuronal population from those that express fosB in the context of maternal responsiveness. Some of the functions of these populations in the maternal animal may be overlapping, but most appear not to be. This hypothesis is based on the data discussed below. In the MPO and BSTv, where there are increases in the numbers of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity as well as FosB immunoreactivity with maternal behavior, there are three to five times more neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity compared with FosB immunoreac-tivity. Therefore, even if every FosB neuron also contained c-Fos, a large subset of c-Fos neurons remains that cannot express FosB. A specific example is highlighted by the more detailed neuroanatomical analysis the MPO and the BSTv. In these two regions, a substantial and statistically significant increase in the number of FosB-Ir neurons in maternal adults occurs only at a single anatomic level Bregma 20.60 mm . At more rostral or caudal levels, only a few neurons expressing FosB immunoreactivity are detected. In contrast, the increase in the number of neurons express-ing c-Fos immunoreactivity in relation to maternal behav-ior occurs over a much larger extent of the MPO and BSTv, covering an area that extends beyond the region in which FosB stimulation is seen. Thus, an extensive region of the MPO contains neurons that use c-Fos in their maternal state, and many of these same neurons cannot use FosB. This implies that these populations in the maternal ani-mal subserve different functions, because different effects on the transcriptional processes of these neurons would be predicted in neurons that use different IEGs. Of course, the possibility remains that, in both juvenile and adults animals, some neurons coexpress both c-Fos and FosB immunoreactivity. This is a finite experimental question that can be addressed easily by using a double-labeling technique for c-Fos and FosB. If these neurons exist in the MPO BSTv, then they most likely are to be found at the limited anatomic level i.e., Bregma 20.60 mm at which expression of maternal behavior in adult animals was associated with the significant increases in number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity as well as FosB immunoreactivity. The presence of both transcription factors in the same neuron could imply some coexistent function in this particular population that will be unique to it, and these neurons could be compared usefully with those populations containing only one of the two IEGs. MPO. Because the MPO is so critical in the mediation of all types of maternal behavior, our goal was to analyze the entire MPO in its complete rostrocaudal extent. Furthermore, we believed that this was especially impor-tant in juveniles, because our previous study indicated that, in juvenile rats, large lesions of the MPO are necessary to block the onset of retrieval and nest-building behaviors Kalinichev et al., 1997, 1999 . This is in con-trast to the fact that even quite small lesions of the MPO will eliminate maternal behavior in the adult. Thus, the MPO seemed likely to be an area in which differences in the responsiveness of the populations would be seen when juveniles were compared with adults. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the neuronal populations of the MPO occupy a key position in the neural circuit that supports maternal behavior in adult rats. Adult females exhibiting maternal behavior had significantly more neurons expressing c-Fos immuno-reactivity 75% and FosB immunoreactivity 80% in the MPO than either of the nonmaternal groups Table 2 . These data are in strong accord with data from older adults showing increases in the number of neurons that express c-Fos immunoreactivity in the MPO in relation to all conditions or phases of maternal behavior, in sensitized or parturient rats, pup-exposed female mice, or pup-exposed male and female prairie voles Calamandrei and Keverne, 1994 Fleming and Walsh, 1994 Fleming et al., 1994 Kirkpatrick et al., 1994 Numan and Numan, 1994, 1995, 1997 Fleming and Korsmit, 1996 Lonstein et al., 1998 Numan et al., 1998 . These data also support recent evidence that links the performance of maternal behavior in adult parturient mice Brown et al., 1996 and lactating rats Numan et al., 1998 with the increase in the number of neurons expressing FosB immunoreactivity in the MPO. The increases in the number of c-Fos-IR and FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO that we have uncovered are character-ized by marked subregional anatomic specificity. The largest increases 100â130% in the number c-Fos-Ir and FosB-Ir neurons occurred in the subregion of the MPO in which the MPN is the largest Bregma 20.60 mm . In addition, there was a significant increase 70â80% in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons but not FosB Ir neurons in the rostral half of the MPO Bregma 20.20 mm and 20.40 mm .Although c-Fos-Ir and FosB-Ir neurons were found at the most caudal levels of the MPO Bregma 20.80 mm , maternal and nonmaternal control animals were not differ-ent at these anatomical levels. The caudal MPO may not be involved in maternal behavior in adult rats. This argument is supported by the evidence that localized lesions placed in the posterior MPO are less effective than lesions of the anterior MPO in disrupting retrieval and nest-building behaviors in sensitized adult female rats Gray and Brooks, 1984 . More specific analysis of the largest subnucleus of the MPO, the MPN, provided results that were almost identi-cal to the results for the complete MPO. These findings are in full accord with the results obtained by others who have demonstrated that lactating maternal females have a similar increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MPO and MPN compared with their nonmaternal controls Numan and Numan, 1995 Lonstein et al., 1998 . Several additional lines of evidence strongly argue that MPO neurons are necessary for the expression of adult maternal behavior. Lesions of the MPO, even quite small lesions, made in adulthood block both hormonally dependent and nonhormonally mediated pup-stimulated display of ma-ternal behavior in female and male rats Numan, 1974 Numan et al., 1977, 1988 Rosenblatt et al., 1996 Kalin-ichev et al., 1999 . Furthermore, lesions of the MPO made in juvenile animals produce severe deficits in their adult maternal behavior, specifically its postpartum onset Cohn and Gerall, 1989 . BSTv. Bilateral lesions of the BSTv severely disrupt the maintenance of maternal behavior in lactating female rats Numan and Numan, 1996 . Our data extend this hypothesis to suggest that the BSTv may be a key area in the onset as well as the maintenance of maternal behavior in adult rats. We found that maternal adults had signifi-cant increases in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity 110% and FosB immunoreactivity 60% in the BSTv compared with nonmaternal controls Table 2 . Our work is also in accord with that of others showing that sensitized or lactating female rats exhibiting maternal behavior show increases in the number of neu-rons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity Numan and Nu-man, 1994, 1995 Numan et al., 1998 or FosB immunore-activity Numan et al., 1998 in the BSTv. According to Numan and Numan 1995 and Walsh et al. 1996 , olfactory or ventral somatosensory desensitization reduces but does not eliminate the increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in relation to maternal behavior. What the conditions are that induce the expression of fosB in the MPO and BSTv but not in other areas studied remains to be determined. It can be hypothesized that the induction of fosB as well as c-fos may be associated with the key role of the MPO and possibly the BSTv in all conditions and phases of adult maternal behavior Numan, 1974 Numan et al., 1977, 1988 Rosenblatt et al., 1996 . Perhaps this involves some key role in integration that generalizes to all phases of the behavior but that cannot be defined more mechanistically under the limits of our current informa-tion on this area. BSTp. Our findings of an increase in the number of c-Fos-labeled neurons in the BSTp in animals that are maternal are in general accord with the findings of Numan and Numan 1994 . Those investigators reported a signifi-cant increase in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity in the BSTp of lactating rats exposed to pups or pup-associated sensory cues. Lactating animals that either were performing maternal behavior or were exposed to pups in a mesh bag, which prevented them from performing maternal behavior, had similar increases in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity in the BSTp compared with lactating animals exposed to candy. The BSTp receives its major afferents from the COA and the MEA Krettek and Price, 1978 Simerly and Swanson, 1986 , therefore receiving polysynaptic input from the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. It can be hypothesized that the increase in the number of BSTp neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity is asso-ciated with input from the COA and the MEA. Indeed, olfactory bulbectomy, which completely abolished the in-crease in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in relation to maternal behavior in the COA and MEA, had a similar effect in the BSTp Numan and Numan, 1995 . BSTd. This is the first study suggesting that the BSTd may play a role in maternal behavior in adult rats. There was a significant increase 70% in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity in the BSTd, including the BSTp of maternal adults, compared with controls Table 2 . In contrast, another recent study indicates that neurons of the BSTd are not necessary for the postpartum maintenance of maternal behavior in the adult rat, be-cause neuron-specific lesions of the BSTd did not impair this phase of the behavior Numan and Numan, 1996 . Based on our findings, we suggest that selective, excito-toxin-induced lesions of the caudal half of the BSTd will impair the onset of pup-mediated expression of maternal behavior in adult rats. Whether the importance of the BSTd for maternal behavior is limited to the pup-induced onset of maternal behavior or also may be involved in the onset in normal parturient dams remains to be tested. Unlike c-Fos, the overall number of neurons expressing FosB immunoreactivity in the BSTd was similar in mater-nal and control groups, with one subtle but noteworthy exception Our detailed anatomic analysis revealed that, at the most rostral level of the BSTd, maternal animals had significantly fewer FosB-Ir neurons than either of the nonmaternal control groups. This is the only area among all of the anatomic regions we investigated in which the expression of maternal behavior was associated with a significant decrease in the number of neurons expressing Fos immunoreactivity. Perhaps the decrease in the num-ber of FosB-Ir neurons in the rostral part of BSTd of maternal adults indicates a decrease in neuronal activity in these neurons that leads to the reduction of an inhibi-tory input presumably to the MPO and, thereby, a disinhibition of maternal behavior. If such a decrease in the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the rostral BSTd is associated with disinhibition of maternal behavior, then specific lesions of this part of the BSTd may facilitate maternal behavior. Other workers have reported cases in which fos expres-sion to a single physiological state can be differential across different brain regions. For example, Clement at al. 1995 also noted both increases and decreases in the number of neurons expressing Fos immunoreactivity in response to noxious stimulation of either deep somatic or deep visceral structures. In anesthetized rats, noxious stimulation increased the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity in a discrete part of the PAGc and intermediate gray lamina of the superior colliculus, whereas it decreased the number in the external sub-nucleus of the inferior colliculus and the stratum opticum of the superior colliculus. In another study, the administra-tion of estrogen and progesterone to ovariectomized female rats increased the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MPO and MEApd compared with the number in oil-treated control females in response to manual vaginocervical stimulation. In contrast, this treatment decreased the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LS, BST, and VMH compared with the same control condition Pfaus et al., 1996 . Amygdala. Our data show that the COA and MEA play important roles in the expression of pup-mediated maternal behavior in adult rats. We found a significant increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the posterior COA 80% and the posterior MEA 60% of maternal adults compared with controls Table 2 . These data sup-port and extend previous findings by others Numan and Numan, 1994 who have report very similar increases in c-Fos-Ir neurons in the amygdala with the onset of pup-mediated maternal behavior or in its postpartum mainte-nance phase. Collectively, these data suggest that the increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the COA and MEAof maternal adults is associated with the reduction of aversive responses toward pups. We hypothesize that this would be the behavioral result of the disinhibition of the amygdaloid output possibly to the MPO and BSTv , that is, the inhibition of the normally inhibitory output of the amygdala. LH. We found a significant increase 100% in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LH of maternal adult animals compared with nonmaternal controls Table 2 . These data are in full accord with our previous evidence that the neurons of the LH mediate the onset of maternal behavior in parturient and sensitized adult females Mat-thews-Felton et al., 1995, 1998 . Although our work with lesions of the LH in lactating animals indicates that this region is not required for the maintenance phase of maternal behavior, Stern and her colleagues found an increase in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immu-noreactivity in the LH during the maintenance phase in lactating maternal females Corodimas et al., 1992 Lon-stein et al., 1998 . The apparent lack of accord between these two types of data indicate a higher level of complex-ity that was noted previously for other areas of the neural circuit that support maternal behavior, in which reports of these two types of data are in accord. One possibility is that fos activation in this area is evidence that the LH is âânotifiedââ by a feed-back or feed-forward loop in the circuit that maternal behavior already is ongoing and that other afferent information should be ignored or suppressed if it would stimulate inappropriately the neural activity that might otherwise lead to the onset of the behavior. Brain regions outside the maternal behavior circuit. The ARH, VMH, and MH, areas currently considered to be outside the neural circuit that supports maternal behavior showed no changes in the number of c-Fos-or FosB-Ir neurons in maternal animals Table 2 . The data from the laboratories of Numan and colleagues and Stern and colleagues are in full accord with our results. They report that lactating maternal animals and isolated control ani-mals had similar numbers of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the VMH Numan and Numan, 1994 Lonstein et al., 1998 Numan et al., 1998 and the ARH Lonstein et al., 1998 . The limitation of changes in fos immunoreactivity in maternal animals to brain regions within the neural circuit that underlies maternal behavior is a key finding supporting the hypothesis that the changes in fos expres-sion are causal to the mediation of maternal behavior by these regions. In fact, the literature on this and many other measures of change in the central nervous system is correlational changes in IEG immunoreactivity correlate with changes in the behavioral state of the animal. Direct proof of the causal relationship of the activation of IEGs in these brain regions to maternal behavior, or any other function, has yet to be produced experimentally. Although it is possible theoretically to approach this experimental problem with antisense technology or antibodies to the protein products of the IEGs, the technical difficulty of these approaches is not minor. A significant additional fact should be noted about these brain regions that we have considered control regions outside the regions that form the known circuit mediating maternal behavior. Others for whom these regions are an experimental endpoint have reported region-specific in-creases in c-Fos-Ir neurons in response to other stimuli. For example, significant increases in c-Fos-immunolabel-ing are found in these brain regions with sexual behavior, exposure to progesterone, removal of suckling stimulation in lactating females, and electrical self-stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus Wessel et al., 1991 Pfaus et al., 1993 Hoffman et al., 1994 Arvanitogiannis et al., 1997 Auger and Blaustein, 1997 . Collectively, our data and the data from these other workers demonstrate convincingly that these brain regions can respond to stimuli with increased fos immunoreactivity but that only stimuli that are relevant functionally are correlated with a fos-immunoreactivity report of IEG activity in these regions. Juveniles Juvenile rats that were maternal exhibited a full and organized pattern of maternal behavior. Like maternal adults, they retrieved and grouped all six pups into the nest within the first few minutes of testing, subsequently crouching over and licking the pups. Although, in general, the control juveniles were nonmaternal in a manner very similar to nonmaternal adults, the nonmaternal juveniles were less avoidant of pups and exhibited interest toward them. Although these nonmaternal juveniles licked pups or hovered over a few pups scattered in the cage, at best, these were fragments of a disorganized form of maternal behavior, and they were not full maternal behavior. The LH of both juvenile and adult animals that were maternal had a substantial increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons compared with the LH of their age-appropriate controls Table 2 . This suggests that the LH, even in juveniles, participates in the neural circuit that supports maternal behavior in an adult-like manner. We can hypothesize that excitotoxin-induced lesions in juve-nile rats will have an adult-like effect, blocking the onset of retrieval and nest-building behaviors. In contrast to the LH, no other brain regions in maternal juveniles showed statistically significantly altered num-bers of Fos-Ir neurons or even trends toward altered Fos activity. This was the case whether it involved brain regions within the neural circuit that mediates maternal behavior, such as the MPO, BSTv, BSTd, COA, and MEA, outside of it, such as the MH, VMH, and ARC Table 2 . The numbers of Fos-Ir cells in these areas were similar overall across the maternal group, both control groups, and the pup-exposed nonmaternal and isolated groups. Therefore, a lack of c-fos and fosB induction in maternal versus pup-exposed yet nonmaternal juveniles cannot be explained by the limited components of maternal behavior carried out by the nonmaternal juveniles body and ano-genital licking Table 1 . The fos response in maternal adults was a notable increase in immunoreactive neurons compared with either their age-appropriate controls or all juvenile groups. It is useful to note that the general number of Fos-Ir neurons in all three groups of juvenile was virtually equal to both control adult groups. This implies a recruitment of neu-rons in the maternal adult from an otherwise stable population in both control adults and juveniles. We hypoth-esize that the lack of c-fos or fosB induction in juveniles in these populations of neurons that are recruited during adult maternal behavior in the MPO, BSTv, BSTd, COA, and MEA in adults reflects the immaturity of these brain regions in juveniles. Exactly what this immaturity con-sists of remains to be determined. Certainly, the ultimate adult state of the neural connectivity and the biochemical mechanisms that mediate maternal behavior still may be developing in the juvenile rat. However, we must keep in mind that juvenile maternal behavior is very adult-like therefore, the difference between adult and juvenile IEG expression in neuronal populations mediating maternal behavior presents an interesting set of questions. Juvenile rats may use all of the same neuroanatomical components of the adult maternal behavior circuit but rely on the induction of other IEGs as the molecular mecha-nism that supports this function. That is, the induction of IEGs does occur in relation to juvenile maternal behavior however, the signal-transduction pathway s does not in-volve c-fos or fosB but involves other IEGs.Alternatively, it is possible that the induction of the same IEGs may take a different time course in the juvenile compared with the adult, so that examining immunoreactivity at different time points with respect to the behavior might be informa-tive. However, there are no good data that support this idea in the literature, and the data on sensitized maternal behavior in the adult would suggest that sensitized mater- nal behavior would activate fos in the same time frame as the parturition-initiated phases of the behavior Fleming et al., 1980 Numan and Numan, 1990 . Several studies have indicated that the expression of IEGs during the early postnatal period undergoes a signifi-cant change and does so in a region-specific manner. In the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of neonatal rats, constitu-tive levels of c-fos mRNA undergo a sharp decline during the first 10 days of postnatal development Parma et al., 1991 . However, in the hypothalamus, levels of c-fos mRNA remain high during this period and decrease only at a later age. In the anatomic regions that were studied, levels of c-myc mRNA increased during the first 5 days then decreased over the next 15 days of postnatal development Parma et al., 1991 . The expression of Fos proteins and Fras also undergo differential development that is ana-tomic region-specific Alcantara and Greenough, 1993 . Expression of Fos and delayed or extended expression of Fras has been detected in the hippocampus and striatum between postnatal days 1 and 9. In the piriform and entorhinal cortices, the concomitant expression of Fos and Fras also occurs between days 1 and 9 however, in the cerebellum, it occurs between days 5 and 10. The authors of these studies suggest that changes in the induction of IEGs may be related to various developmental events, such as cell proliferation, neurite outgrowth, and myelina-tion. The lack of c-fos induction in association with the functional immaturity of an anatomic region related to a specific behavioral task has been described by others Waters et al., 1997 . When exposed to a Y-maze, juvenile rats ages 16 days, 23 days, and 30 days are similar in their performance of a nonhippocampal-dependent task i.e., the number of arm entries , whereas only animals age 30 days perform a hippocampal-dependent test i.e., spontaneous alternation . In accord with the functional maturity of the hippocampus, only in animals age 30 days, but not in younger animals, does exposure to a Y-maze result in a significant increase in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity and a decrease in the ability to induce long-term potentiation Waters et al., 1997 . MPO. In our previous study, using a different experi-mental approach, we showed that neuronal populations of the MPO mediate some, but not all, of the components of juvenile maternal behavior. Bilateral, excitotoxin-induced lesions of the MPO produced a differential effect on maternal behavior in juvenile rats age 27 days compared with adult rats age 60 days. In juveniles, large but not small lesions of the MPO blocked the onset of retrieval behavior and impaired nest-building, whereas crouching and licking behaviors were unaffected. In contrast, in adults, both large and small lesions of the MPO blocked the onset of retrieval, nest-building, crouching, and licking behaviors Gray and Brooks, 1984 Numan et al., 1977, 1988 . Our data are in strong accord with the findings of Natterer and Fleming 1997 , who found that electrolytic lesions of the MPO impaired retrieval and nest-building behaviors but had no effect on the latencies for licking or crouching in juvenile rats ages 23â27 days. Part of the rationale for the current study was to examine the entire forebrain of the juvenile with a method, such as fos-activation patterns, that would provide a functional overview of all of the structures that may support maternal behavior in the juvenile. One specula-tive hypothesis was that different structures or different populations of neurons within a structure, such as the MPO, may support maternal behavior in juveniles com-pared with adults. Now, we must consider interpretations that take both data sets into account one shows that only quite large MPO lesions disrupt maternal behavior in juveniles, and the second shows the lack of recruitment of MPO neurons that express c-Fos and FosB in the juvenile maternal state. That is, the interconnections or neurochem-istry within the MPO that subserve juvenile maternal behavior are sufficient functionally, yet they are different from those in the adult. What these differences within the MPO are remains an important question to be approached experimentally. We can speculate that, because juveniles are less inhibited in their maternal responses, and because adults must over-come what appears to be a neophobic inhibition of mater-nal behavior, the activation of the fos family in the maternal neural circuit may be related to this difference. Therefore, it may be the case that fos is activated in adults to overcome a natural inhibited set point of the system and that, in the juveniles, this is not necessary. It is possible that afferents to the MPO that normally are inhibitory to maternal behavior are immature, i.e., not morphologically or neurochemically complete, in the juvenile therefore, these animals are more maternally responsive than the adults. The adult may be inhibited from maternal behav-ior, and a disinhibition requiring the use of the fos family may be a step in the achievement of the maternal state. The juvenile may have yet to reach the usual adult state of maternal inhibition, and a disinhibition may not be neces-sary. Considering the theoretical constructions of Fleming and colleagues 1980 and Numan and Numan 1990 , there is an alternative way to consider these concepts. Possibly, the juvenile operates from a more motivated base line, i.e., is more motivated to perform maternal behavior, and fos activity in the adult may be needed to add some neural events that constitute this increased motivation. The fact that juveniles, because of their smaller size, need to perform a heavier load of work than adults to retrieve a pup to the nest can be used to support this hypothesis. A corollary of this idea is that juveniles may be expected to become maternal i.e., sensitized faster when exposed to pups.Although there is some suggestion that this is true in younger juveniles, the latency in days for the juveniles and adults to become maternal in this study was not different thus, our data do not provide support for this idea. When considering the circuit that supports maternal behavior, we really do not know where these neural events are located, although it does seem likely that they occur in several of the structures of the circuit that includes the MPO and the amygdala. Amygdala. In accord with the behavioral results of others, we found that juveniles are less avoidant of pups than adults and exhibit shorter latencies for maternal behavior Bridges et al., 1974 Mayer and Rosenblatt, 1979 Stern, 1987 . This is based in part on the absence of avoidance responses in juveniles to pup odors and their lack of timidity toward pups compared with adults. Por-tions of the amygdala Fleming et al., 1980 Numan and Numan, 1990 mediate some of these responses in adults. Because juvenile rats do not need to overcome pup aver-sion to exhibit maternal behavior, it was not surprising to find that, in the COA and MEA, maternal and nonmater-nal juveniles were similar in the number of neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity. In contrast, in adult rats, expression of maternal behavior appears to be depen-dent on overcoming aversive reactions toward pups, and a statistically significant increase in fos activity was seen in these regions in the maternal adult. According to a recent study Natterer and Fleming, 1997 , electrolytic lesions of the MEA shorten the latencies for maternal behavior even in juvenile rats ages 23â27 days. These results suggest that neuronal populations of the MEA inhibit maternal behavior in juvenile rats. In our study, the numbers of c-Fos-Ir neurons increased in nonma-ternal, pup-exposed juveniles compared with controls that were not exposed to pups, and the numbers increased further in juveniles exhibiting maternal behavior. How-ever, the difference across maternal and control groups did not reach statistical significance. We hypothesize that the involvement of the MEA and the COA in maternal behav-ior of juvenile rats is not yet fully mature but that it is a part of the neural circuit, like the LH, that matures earlier than other regions, for example, the MPO or the BST. This immaturity may be measured empirically in the lack of significant increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in these areas in relation to maternal behavior and lesser expression of aversive responses toward newborns com-pared with adult animals. Nonetheless, we do not under-stand what constitutes this lack of maturity on any mechanistic level, for example, on the molecular or neural level. Additional examination may reveal neuronal popula-tions in other brain regions that have increased IEG response during the maternal state. Anatomic areas that process olfactory and vomeronasal information such, as the main olfactory bulb, the accessory olfactory bulb AOB , and the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract BAOT , appear to inhibit pup-mediated expression of maternal behavior in virgin adult animals. These regions would be top candidates for roles in the support of facili-tated maternal behavior in juveniles Fleming and Rosen-blatt, 1974b Del Cerro et al., 1991 Izquierdo et al., 1992 . How IEG response in these areas correlates with the maternal state is not clear, but the sum of the response may be an efferent signal that disinhibits other portions of the maternal circuit. Also, in sensitized adult females, the expression of maternal behavior is associated with a decrease in the levels of [14C]2-deoxyglucose in several areas that process vomeronasal information AOB, BAOT, and MEA compared with nonmaternal controls Del Cerro et al., 1995 . This may be a measure of less activity in these regions that would be activated in the nonmaternal rat to inhibit maternal behavior. Other brain regions that are known to play a role in the maintenance of maternal behavior, and not in the onset phases, could provide a useful context for the IEG stimula-tion seen in juveniles that become maternal by sensitiza-tion. For example, a subregion of the central gray, the PAGc at the intercollicular level, is necessary for the expression of upright crouching kyphotic posture in lactating female rats Lonstein and Stern, 1997a,b . Bilat-eral lesions of this area reduced the time spent in kyphotic nursing by 85% in these animals, whereas low crouching as well as retrieval and nest-building behaviors were unaffected Lonstein and Stern, 1997a,b . Because sensi-tized adult females and juveniles most often lay prone on top of pups with no limb support and rarely exhibit kyphosis Lonstein et al., 1999 Kalinichev, unpublished observation , it is possible that this central gray region does not play an IEG-mediated role in the sensitized onset of maternal behavior. Taken together, our data provide information to suggest a number of further experiments focusing on the neuronal and molecular components of the neural circuit that mediates maternal behavior. Neurons that express c-Fos immunoreactivity and FosB immunoreactivity in mater-nal animals can be considered as functionally identified subsets of neurons in these brain regions that can be studied particularly for their neural connectivity and neurochemical content. These neurons can provide a focus for further functional parceling and characterization of large and complex brain regions such, as the MPO, and should provide information that will enable a more de-tailed understanding of what specific roles these brain regions and these subsets of neurons play in the mediation of maternal behavior. In the case of juvenile animals, the general lack of evidence that these particular IEGs play a role in the mediation of maternal behavior suggests that the role of other IEGs should be investigated. Further-more, it is possible that the time in development when c-Fos and FosB do begin to participate in the mediation of maternal behavior may be of particular importance and, hence, is worth determining. For example, our data indi-cate that animals ages 27â37 days do not use these IEGs but that this mechanism comes into use by 60â70 days. Determining precisely when this mechanism comes into use and what regulates this change may inform us about the mechanisms of neural plasticity that underlie behav-ioral plasticity. RESULTS Behavioral observations The number of days of pup exposure required to estab-lish maternal behavior was not statistically different for the juveniles compared with the adults. Juveniles took on average 4.2 days of pup exposure to become maternal, whereas the adults took 2.3 days. Once they became maternal, the adults and juveniles were virtually identical in their behavior toward pups, including during the 2-hour period of reexposure to the pups after overnight separa-tion. During this behavioral observation period, the per-centage of animals exhibiting retrieval, pup carrying, crouching, and body and anogenital licking were similar in maternal juveniles and maternal adults Table 1 . The quality of the performance of the key components of maternal behavior in maternal juveniles and maternal adults also was virtually identical. Individuals in both groups were quick ,3 minutes to retrieve and group all six test pups in the nest and, once the pups were in the nest, spent similar amounts of time in with them and crouching over them. Some minor differences in the extent of maternal behav-ior were noted when juveniles and adults were compared. For example, juvenile rats that exhibited maternal behav-ior performed at even higher frequencies P , 0.05 of pup carrying than maternal adults did. The duration of a few of the secondary components of maternal behavior body and anogenital licking was longer in maternal adults than in maternal juveniles P , 0.05 . There were interesting and predictable differences be-tween the behaviors of juvenile and adult control groups, all of which were nonmaternal. The pup-exposed control adults spent most of the time away from the pups and did not exhibit any components of maternal behavior Table 1 . Although pup-exposed control juveniles failed to retrieve even a single pup to the nest, they did exhibit disorganized expression of some components of maternal behavior. For example, the nonmaternal juveniles spent greater time in proximity to pups and engaged in increased licking of the body and anogenital regions of the pups. Although these juveniles hovered-over a few pups scattered in the cage, this behavior was significantly shorter and was not over the organized grouping of pups seen in the crouching behavior of maternal juveniles Table 1 . Although these differences in behavior across adult and juvenile animals are noteworthy, nonetheless, these pup-exposed juveniles never achieved the criterion to be considered maternal, because retrieval and grouping of all pups were defining elements of maternal behavior. The isolated control animals, both juveniles and adults, were active only during the first few minutes after cage-lid removal. Their activity consisted of brief bouts of self-grooming, locomotion, and rearing. For most of the test period isolated control animals were inactive and asleep. Immunocytochemical parameters for c-Fos localization A dilution of primary antibody of 1 100 did not result in the visualization of labeled neurons above background due to a high immunocytochemical staining in the neuropil. Dilutions of the c-Fos primary antibody at 1 500 or 1 1,000 revealed both many labeled neurons and a fairly low background. Because virtually identical numbers of immu-nolabeled neurons were found with these dilutions, we chose a dilution of primary antibody at 1 1,000, which produced a lower background of immunocytochemical stain-ing in the neuropil. A dilution of secondary antibody at 1 600 and a reaction time of 1.5 minutes were chosen as optimal, because a higher concentration of the secondary antibody or a longer reaction time increased the back-ground, effecting the signal-to-noise ratio unfavorably. Distribution of c-Fos-Ir neurons The c-Fos-Ir neurons were easily identifiable by the presence of black dark purple reaction product within the neuronal nuclei, as seen in Figures 1 and 2. Illustrations include low-power montages of the preoptic area and medial basal hypothalamus Figs. 1, 2 and precise neuron-by-neuron maps of five sections made with the Neurolu-cida program Fig. 3 . Although maternal animals had more c-Fos-Ir neurons in many areas, it was not surprising that the overall neuroanatomical distribution of these neu- rons and regions that had the greatest densities of these neurons was similar in juvenile and adult rats in the maternal and control animals. Because the maternal adults had the largest number of c-Fos-Ir neurons, these were used to illustrate the distribution of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the forebrain Fig. 3 . The highest densities of c-Fos-Ir neurons were found in the MPO, BSTv, BSTd, MEA, neocortex, and lateral hypo-thalamus LHA . Less dense distributions of c-Fos-Ir neu-rons were found in COA, LPO, SI, LS, caudoputamen CP , anterior hypothalamus AHA , and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus PVT . Only a few, scattered, c-Fos-Ir neurons were found in MH, medial septum MS , globus pallidus GP , and zona incerta ZI . Quantitative analysis of c-Fos-Ir neurons in juvenile and adult rats MPO. The number of c-Fos-Ir neurons was similar in maternal and nonmaternal juveniles throughout the MPO Fig. 5A . Maternal and nonmaternal juveniles were simi-lar in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons expressed through-out the MPO even after a more anatomically detailed analysis comparing individual anatomic levels Fig. 5C Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm . Similar results were obtained when the MPN was analyzed separately data not presented . In contrast, maternal adults had 75% more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MPO compared with their two nonmaternal control groups F[2,13] 5 8.73 P , 0.01 Fig. 5B . A similar increase was observed when the MPN was analyzed separately data not presented . Figure 4A left presents a photomicrograph of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MPO of mater-nal adult rats, and Figure 4B right shows neurons in the nonmaternal adult. A more anatomically detailed analysis of each individual level of the MPO revealed that maternal and control groups in adults differed significantly at three out of four anatomic levels of the MPO all P , 0. 05 Bregma 20.20 mm, 20.40 mm, and 20.60 mm Fig. 5D . The maternal and nonmaternal control groups were simi-lar in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons at the most caudal level Bregma 20.80 mm of the MPO Fig. 5D . BSTv. In juvenile rats, the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the BSTv was similar in the maternal group and in both nonmaternal control groups Fig. 6A . This was true even when the four anatomic levels of the BSTv that were compared individually with their appropriate controls Fig. 6C Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm . In contrast, adult rats exhibiting maternal behavior had significantly greater numbers c-Fos-Ir neurons in the BSTv as a whole compared with nonmaternal control animals F[2,13] 5 20.34 P , 0.001 Fig. 6B . On average, maternal adults had 110% more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the BSTv than nonma-ternal control animals. Detailed analysis of the BSTv revealed that significant differences across the maternal group and both control groups were found at all four anatomic levels Fig. 6D all P , 0.05 Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm . BSTd. The number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the BSTd was similar in maternal and nonmaternal control juve-niles Fig. 7A . Even with a more detailed anatomic analysis, the number of immunoreactive neurons in mater-nal and control groups were very similar at each anatomic level of the BSTd Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm Fig. 7C . This also was the case when the principle nucleus of the BST BSTp was analyzed independently data not presented separately . In contrast, maternal adults had 70% more c-Fos-Ir neurons, a significantly greater number, in the BSTd compared with nonmaternal control adults Fig. 7B F[2,13] 5 15.77 P , 0.001 . A detailed analysis of the BSTd revealed that maternal adults had a statistically greater number of c-Fos-Ir neurons at two specific caudal levels of the BSTd Bregma 20.60 mm and 20.80 mm Fig. 7D and when BSTp was analyzed independently data not presented separately . COA and MEA. In juvenile rats, the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons across two rostrocaudal levels of the COA was similar in the maternal group and in both nonmater-nal control groups Fig. 8A . In contrast, adult rats exhibit-ing maternal behavior had significantly more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the COA compared with nonmaternal controls F[2,13] 5 6.16 P 5 0.01 Fig. 8B These maternal adults had 80% more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the COAthan nonmater-nal controls. In juvenile rats, the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MEA was similar in the maternal group and in both nonmaternal control groups Fig. 8C . Maternal adults had significantly more c-Fos-Ir neurons, 60%, in the MEA compared with nonmaternal controls Fig. 8D F[2,13] 5 9.18 P , 0.01 . The statistical difference across adult maternal and control groups persisted when MEApv and MEApd were analyzed independently data not presented separately . LH. The number of c-Fos-Ir neurons within the LH was significantly higher in juveniles exhibiting maternal behavior than in nonmaternal control juveniles [Fig. 9A Bregma 22.80 mm to 24.40 mm F 5 3.86, P , 0.05]. On average, maternal juveniles had 80% more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LH than nonmaternal control juveniles. Detailed analysis of the LH at each of the nine rostrocau-dal levels of the LH revealed that maternal animals had a greater number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the central one-third of the LH Fig. 9C Bregma 23.40 mm to 24.20 mm . The differences across the groups reached statistical signifi-cance P , 0.05 at Bregma 23.60 mm and Bregma Similar to juveniles, adult animals exhibiting maternal behavior also had significantly more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LH than either pup-exposed or isolated control adults Fig. 9B F[2,16] 5 3.97 P , 0.05 . On average, maternal adults had 100% more c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LH than nonmaternal controls. Detailed analysis of the LH in adults also revealed that maternal animals had a greater number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the central one-third of the LH than nonmaternal controls Fig. 9D Bregma 23.20 mm to 24.00 mm . The differences across groups reached statistical significance all P , 0.05 at Bregma 23.40 mm and 24.00 mm. The data reported in Figure 9 were gathered by counting the number of immunoreactive neurons in the LH by eye with the intention of comparing the relative number of these neurons across experimental conditions. This method of comparison is described above see Materials an Meth-ods , and our preparations met with the necessary condi-tions for this type of analysis. The discrete nature of the LH and its importance in the neural circuit that regulates the onset of maternal behav-ior lead us to sample the utility of stereologic analysis for assessing differences across groups in this region.Astereo-logic analysis of the adult LH revealed that the total number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LH was higher in maternal adult animals compared with nonmaternal con-trols. Stereologic methods of analysis and the more conven-tional methods of two-dimensional analysis of relative number of immunoreactive neurons across experimental conditions demonstrated almost identical differences be-tween maternal and nonmaternal groups. This informa-tion provides a further validation of the usefulness our assessment of the relative differences across experimental groups. Brain regions outside the maternal behavior circuit. The number of c-Fos-Ir neurons at two rostrocaudal levels of theARH or VMH was similar in maternal and nonmater-nal juveniles Fig. 10A,C . Similarly, in adults, maternal animals and nonmaternal controls did not differ in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the ARH or VMH Fig. 10B,D . In juveniles, the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons at nine different rostrocaudal levels of the MH was similar in the maternal group and in both nonmaternal control groups, that is, either pup exposed or isolated from pups Fig. 10A Bregma 22.80 mm to 24.40 mm . Similarly, maternal and nonmaternal control adults did not differ in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the MH Fig. 11B . Immunocytochemical parameters for FosB We found similar numbers of labeled cells and a similar intensity of FosB-Ir staining per nucleus with primary antibody dilutions at 1 250 or 1 500. When the primary antibody was diluted to 1 1,000, there was a clear decline in both the number of FosB-Ir neurons and the intensity of staining per neuron. A dilution of the primary antibody at 1 500 was chosen over a dilution of 1 250 because of the lighter neuropil staining it produced. A reaction time of 3 minutes in the chromagen increased the background with-out increasing the number of labeled cells therefore, a reaction time of 1.5 minutes was chosen. Distribution of FosB-Ir neurons The FosB-Ir neurons were easily identifiable by the presence of black dark purple reaction product within the neuronal nuclei Figs. 12, 13 . Illustrations include low-power montages of the preoptic area and medial basal hypothalamus Figs. 12, 13 and precise neuron-by-neuron maps of five sections made with the Neurolucida program Fig. 14 . Although maternal animals had more FosB-Ir neurons in some areas, it was not surprising that the overall neuroanatomic distribution of these neurons and regions that had the greatest densities of these neurons was similar in juvenile and adult rats in both maternal animals and control animals. Because the maternal adults had the largest number of FosB-Ir neurons when all areas were considered, representative sections from this condi-tion are presented to illustrate the distribution of FosB-Ir neurons. The highest densities of FosB-Ir neurons were found in the middle Bregma 20.60 mm of the MPO and BSTv as well as the ventral pallidum, MEApd, and neocortex layers 2, 3, and 6 . A less dense distribution of FosB-Ir neurons was found in the BSTd, GP, and regions of the CP. Only a few scattered FosB-Ir neurons were found in the rostral MPO, SI, or the MH. Quantitative analysis of FosB-Ir neurons in juvenile and adult rats MPO. The number of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO as a whole was similar in juveniles exhibiting maternal behav-ior compared with both types of nonmaternal controls, either pup exposed or isolated from pups Fig. 16A .Amore detailed, neuroanatomically based analysis of the area showed that the similarity across the groups also was present at each of four rostrocaudal levels of the MPO Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm Fig. 16C . The number of FosB-Ir neurons also was similar across these animal groups in the MPN data not presented . In contrast, maternal adults had a substantially greater number of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO as a whole compared with that of nonmaternal controls Fig. 16B F[2,18] 5 5.33 P , 0.05 . Figure 15 presents a photomicro-graph of FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO of maternal adult rats compared with nonmaternal controls. On average, maternal adults had 80% more FosB-Ir neurons in the MPO than nonmaternal controls. A more neuroanatomi-cally detailed analysis of the MPO revealed that the difference across maternal and control groups was statisti-cally significant only at one anatomic level P , 0.05 Bregma 20.60 mm Fig. 16D . At this level, where the MPN is most prominent, maternal adults had 135% more FosB-Ir neurons than nonmaternal controls Fig. 16D . A separate analysis of the MPN also revealed similar results data not shown . BSTv. The number of FosB-Ir neurons in the BSTv were similar in juveniles exhibiting maternal behavior compared with either of the nonmaternal control groups Fig. 17A . No further differences were revealed when each of the four anatomic levels of the BSTv were analyzed separately Fig. 17C Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm . In contrast, in adults, the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the BSTv examined as a whole was significantly higher in maternal animals than in nonmaternal controls F[2, 5 18] 3.43 P 5 0.05 Fig. 17B . On average, maternal adults had 60% more FosB-Ir neurons. A more neuroanatomically detailed analysis revealed that maternal and nonmaternal animals differed significantly in the number of FosB-Ir neurons only at one anatomic level of the BSTv P , 0.01 Bregma 20.60 mm Fig. 17D . At this level, maternal adults had 180% more FosB-Ir neurons in the BSTv than nonmaternal controls Fig. 17D . The increased number of FosB-Ir neurons in the BSTv was at the same rostral-caudal level as that revealed by similar analysis in the MPO Figs. 16D, 17D . It is possible that these neurons, in fact, are part of the same population of Fos-responsive neurons that encompasses parts of two different nuclei. BSTd. In juveniles, the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the BSTd was similar in maternal animals and nonmater-nal controls Fig. 18A . Detailed analysis revealed that the maternal and control groups were similar at each of the four anatomic levels of the BSTd Bregma 20.20 mm to 20.80 mm Fig. 18C or when the BSTp was analyzed independently data not presented separately . Similar to juveniles, the number of FosB-Ir neurons in the BSTd generally was similar across maternal and control adults Fig. 18C . An exception to this was seen from a detailed analysis of the BSTd, which revealed that, at the most rostral level of the BSTd, animals exhibiting maternal behavior had 30% fewer FosB-Ir neurons [F 5 3.14 P 5 0.06 Bregma 20.20 mm Fig. 18D]. The number of FosB-Ir neurons was similar across the groups on each of other three levels of the BSTd Bregma 20.40 mm, 20.60 mm, and 20.80 mm Fig. 18D or when the BSTp was analyzed independently data not presented separately . COA and MEA. In juveniles, the number of FosB-Ir neurons across two rostrocaudal levels of the COA was similar in maternal and nonmaternal animals in both pup-exposed and isolated juveniles Fig. 19A . This also was true in adults Fig. 19B . The number of FosB-Ir neurons across two rostrocaudal levels of the MEA was similar in maternal and nonmaternal juveniles and adults Fig. 19C,D . LH. The number of FosB-Ir neurons in the LH was similar in juveniles exhibiting maternal behavior and their nonmaternal controls Fig. 20A . Detailed analysis of the LH revealed similarity across these groups at each of the nine anatomic levels of the LH Bregma 22.80 mm to 24.40 mm Fig. 20C . The adult rats also had a similar number of FosB-Ir neurons in the LH across all groups Fig. 20B this also was true at each of the nine levels of the LH Fig. 20D . Furthermore, a stereologic analysis of the LH in adult animals also revealed that the total number of FosB-Ir neurons in the LH was similar across these maternal and control groups. Maternal and nonmaternal juveniles had similar numbers of FosB-Ir neurons in the ARH and VMH Fig. 21A,C . Similarly, in adults, the number of FosB-Ir neurons across maternal and nonmaternal control groups was not differ-ent in theARH and the VMH Fig. 21B,D . In juveniles, the number of FosB-Ir neurons across nine rostrocaudal levels of the MH was similar in maternal and nonmaternal control groups Fig. 22A Bregma 22.80 mm to 24.40 mm . The same was true of the adults Fig. 22B . Relative number of c-Fos-IR and FosB-Ir neurons in juvenile and adults In general, there were very similar numbers of Fos-Ir neurons in juveniles and adults. The only exception was the ARH, in which there were substantially fewer FosB-Ir neurons in juveniles than in adults. In the areas in which maternal adults had significant increases in numbers of Fos-Ir neurons but juveniles did not, the number of immunoreactive neurons was similar across all juvenile groups and the two control adult groups. Within the LH of maternal animals, both adults and juveniles had a similar number of c-Fos-Ir neurons and had considerably more c-Fos-Ir neurons compared with their appropriate controls of each age. The juvenile and adult controls also had a similar number of c-Fos-Ir neurons in the LH. Thus, in both juveniles and adults, the increase in the number of immunoreactive neurons appears to emerge from a back-ground of an immunoreactive population that is similar quantitatively in the controls of the two age groups, suggesting that, in specific regions, an additional popula-tion of neurons is recruited into an active state when the animals are maternal and that this recruitment occurs in more areas of the adult than the juvenile for these two IEGs. When the number of neurons that expressed the two different IEGs was compared, there were more neurons expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity than FosB immunore-activity. This was true in all regions examined by specific counting of the immunoreactive neurons, and it appeared to hold true for regions that were assessed only by Neuro-lucida mapping for example, the thalamus and the neocor-tex Figs. 3, 14 . Although the general neuroanatomical distributions of neurons that express c-Fos and FosB were similar across all groups of animalsâadults and juveniles, maternal and nonmaternalâthe subset of neurons that expressed FosB always was located within a subregion of the more extensive neuroanatomical distribution of the c-Fos-Ir neurons.

As the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system CNS , g-aminobutyric acid GABA plays important roles in regulating neuronal activity, plasticity, and pathogenesis. Its action is mediated through distinct type A, B, or C GABAA, GABAB, or GABAC receptors. In contrast to the ionotropic GABAA and GABAC receptors that mediate fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials IPSP , the metabotropic GABAB receptor GABABR mediates slow, long-lasting inhibitory neuronal responses that have been implicated in many important physiological func-tions and pathologic alterations in the brain Bowery et al., 1990 Soltesz and Crunelli, 1992 Bonanno and Raiteri, 1993b Mott and Lewis, 1994 Misgeld et al., 1995 Bowery, 1997 Deisz, 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . GABABRs have been demonstrated in both pre-and postsynaptic compo-nents of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the central nervous system. Their existence in glia cells has also been reported Hosli and Hosli, 1990 Hosli et al., 1990 Fraser et al., 1994 . Presynaptic GABABR-mediated auto-heteroinhibition represents a classic, well-known model for regulation of neurotransmitter release and has been subjected to extensive pharmacologic and electro-physiological studies in a variety of brain structures. Postsynaptic GABABRs mediate a late IPSP that may results in long-term changes in neurotransmission and dynamic response behavior of neurons Misgeld et al., 1995 Davies and Collingridge, 1996 Mouginot and Gahwiler, 1996 Bowery, 1997 Deisz, 1997 Isaacson and Hille, 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . Among other findings, previous pharmacologic and elec-trophysiological studies have suggested the existence of different subtypes of GABABRs at pre-or postsynaptic sites and in different cell types and brain structures Dutar and Nicoll, 1988 Bonanno and Raiteri, 1993b Fukuda et al., 1993 Pitler andAlger, 1994 Bowery, 1997 Deisz et al., 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . The distribution of GABABR in the CNS has been demonstrated with receptor binding autoradiography Bowery et al., 1987 Chu et al., 1990 Knott et al., 1993 Turgeon and Albin, 1993 . Expression of GABABR1 mRNA in the rat brain and in the monkey thalamus has been shown by using radioisotope labeled riboprobes that recognize both of the two major GABABR1 mRNA variants, GABABR1a and GABABR1b Kaupmann et al., 1997 Munoz et al., 1998 Lu et al., 1999 . In addition, GABABR1 immunoreactivity in the rat brain and retina and GABABR1a and GABABR1b mRNA variant distribution in the cerebellar cortex and mouse retina have been reported Kaupmann et al., 1998b Koulen et al., 1998 Zhang et al., 1998 Fritschy et al., 1999 Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999 . However, it is still unclear how the two major GABABR1 mRNA variants are distributed in different neuronal cell types in the CNS and how the possible differences in their distribution may contribute to the heterogeneity of GABABR-mediated late IPSP and hetero-autoinhibition of neurotransmitter release in vari-ous CNS structures. To address these issues, we mapped, at cellular level, the expression of GABABR1 gene and its two major mRNA variants, GABABR1a and GABABR1b, in the rat brain by using nonradioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry. Of particular interests and obvious functional roles are GABABRs on GABA neurons. GABABRs on somata dendrites of GABA neurons may serve as a mechanism to reduce GABA neuronal activity disinhibition by recur-rent collaterals or by GABAergic input from other GABA neurons. GABABRs on GABAergic axon terminals autore-ceptors play important roles in regulating GABA release in a frequency-dependent manner. Both processes may act as gating mechanisms for the generation of long-term potentiation LTP and other types of use-dependent modi-fication of neuronal excitability Floran et al., 1988 Deisz and Prince, 1989 Giralt et al., 1990 Davies et al., 1991 Mott and Lewis, 1991 Metherate and Ashe, 1994 Doze et al., 1995 Hosford et al., 1995 Morishita and Sastry, 1995 Brucato et al., 1996 Caddick and Hosford, 1996 Bonanno et al., 1997 . Although GABAB receptors on GABAergic axon terminals or somata have been demonstrated pharma-cologically and electrophysiologically in a variety of brain structures, further clarification of their distribution and heterogeneity at molecular level would not only advance our understanding of the function of this important class of inhibitory receptor, but also facilitate the search for more selective GABABR agonists antagonists Floran et al., 1988 Harrison et al., 1988 Giralt et al., 1990 Seabrook et al., 1991 Davies and Collingridge, 1993 Lambert and Wilson, 1993 Doze et al., 1995 Ulrich and Huguenard, 1996 Jarolimek and Misgeld, 1997 Kim et al., 1997 Le Feuvre et al., 1997 Vigot and Batini, 1997 Mouginot et al., 1998 Koulen et al., 1998 . Therefore, the second aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of GABABR1a and 1b mRNA variants in different types of GABAneurons of the rat brain by using immunocytochem-istry in situ hybridization histochemistry double-labeling techniques. Our results indicated that the distribution of GABABR1a in the CNS markedly differed from that of GABABR1b in different GABA and non-GABAergic neu-rons. Preliminary results have been reported in abstract form Liang et al., 1998 . MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA cloning and in vitro transcription Rat brain mRNA was isolated from a 12-day-old rat pup Wistar strain . First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription by using SuperScript II kit Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY . GABABR1 cDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and isolated by electrophoresis on agarose gel. They were then subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK vector Strata-gene, La Jolla, CA . JM109 competent cells Stratagene were transformed by the respective recombinant plasmids and cultured on LB plates containing ampicillin, isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactoside IPTG and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactoside Xgal . White colonies were picked up from the plate and cultured in 23 TY medium contain-ing ampicillin. Recombinant plasmids were purified from the culture and the inserts were verified by sequence analysis by using an ABI 310 or ABI 377 DNA sequencer Perkin-Elmer, Foster, CA . Three cDNA fragments were cloned. GABABR1a frag-ment is specific for GABABR1a variant, has a C1G ratio of 61.78% and corresponds to nucleotides 1 to 437 of rat GABABR1a gene EMBL accession number Y10369 . GABABR1b is specific for GABABR1b variant, has a C1G ratio of 72.73% and corresponds to nucleotides 21 to 141 of rat GABABR1b gene EMBL accession number Y10370 . GABABR1p recognizes both GABABR1a and GABABR1b variants, has a C1G ratio of 57.60% and corresponds to nucleotides 2408â2841 2060â2493 of rat GABABR1a GABABR1b gene. The purified plasmids were linearized and then used as templates for in vitro transcription of digoxigenin-labeled antisense or sense control RNA probes with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. The nucleoside triphosphate mix for in vitro transcription consists of 10 mM ATP, 10 mM CTP, 10 mM GTP, 6.5 mM UTP, and 3.5 mM digoxigenin-11-UTP. According to the supplier Boehringer Mannheim, Mann-heim, Germany average digoxigenin-11-UTP incorpora-tion into transcribed RNA is about 4â5% of all nucleotides. In situ hybridization Sixteen adult rats Wistar strain of either sex, ages 10 to 14 weeks and weighing 160â240 grams, were deeply anesthetized with Nembutal 60 mg kg, i.p. and transcar-dially perfused with physiological saline about 50 ml followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer 800 ml, pH 7.4 . The brain and spinal cord were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 4â6 hours at 4Â°C. They were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4Â°C for 24â48 hours. Thirty-five-micrometer frozen sections were cut on a freezing microtome. All procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Riken Animal Care Committee. In situ hybridization histochemistry followed a protocol modified from previous descriptions Liang and Jones, 1997 Hatanaka and Jones, 1998 . Free-floating sections were rinsed twice in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 and then treated sequentially with 0.75% glycine 15 minutes 3 2 , 0.3% Triton X-100 10 minutes , 1 Î¼g ml proteinase K 15 minutes and 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine 15 minutes . After two washes in 23 saline sodium citrate SSC 13 SSC 5 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na3C6H5O7 ? 2H2O and 1 hour prehybridization at 60Â°C in a hybridization buffer pH 7.0 without probe, sections were hybridized at 60Â°C for approximately 14â16 hours in a new hybridization buffer pH 7.0 that contained one of the digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. The hybridiza-tion buffer consisted of 2â53 SSC see below , 2% blocking reagent Boehringer Mannheim , 50% deionized for-mamide, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine. SSC concentration in the hybridization buffer was varied between 23 and 53 to offset differences in melting temperature derived from variations in the length and G1C content of each probes. Probe concentrations of approximately 0.07â0.18 Î¼g ml for GABABR1a, GABABR1p and 0.25 Î¼g ml for GABABR1b were used. At the end of hybridization, sections were sequentially treated in the following solutions except for ribonuclease A, all containing 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine 23 SSC plus 50% deionized formamide, 60Â°C, twice, 20 minutes each ribonuclease A buffer 0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, plus 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl , room temperature, 10 minutes ribonucleaseA 0.02 mg ml in ribonuclease A buffer , 37Â°C, 30 minutes 23 SSC, 60Â°C, twice, 20 minutes each 0.23 SSC, room temperature and then 60Â°C, 20 minutes each. To visualize hybridization signals by immunoalkaline phosphatase histochemistry, sections were rinsed in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffered saline TBS, pH 7.5, 10 minutes , incu-bated in 1% blocking reagent in TBS, 60 minutes , and then in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody Fab fragments, Boehringer Mann-heim, 1 1,500 dilution in TBS, pH7.5, plus 1% blocking reagent, 60 minutes . After three washes in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, alkaline phosphatase AP activity was visual-ized either by nitroblue tetrazolium NBT and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate BCIP or by 2-hydroxy-3-naphtoic acid-28-phenylanilide phosphate and fast red TR. The former reaction gave rise to a blue precipitate in hybridization-positive cells, whereas the latter produced a red fluorescent deposit with a maximum absorbance at 550 nm and maximum emission at 562 nm. The NBT-BCIP reaction lasted for 6â18 hours at room temperature in a substrate solution consisting of 0.033% NBT, 0.017% BCIP, 0.001 M levamisole, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.05 M MgCl2 ? 6H2O in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5. The fluorescent AP reaction lasted for 0.5â2 hours at room temperature in a substrate solution consisting of 0.01% 2-hydroxy-3-naph-toic acid-28-phenylanilide phosphate, 0.025% fast red TR, 0.001 M levamisole, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.01 M MgCl2 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 . Sections were then either processed further for GABA immunocytochemistry for double labeling see below or mounted on chrome alum-gelatinâcoated glass slides, air-dried, and cover-slipped by using an aqueous mounting medium. Negative control experiments included hybridization that used sense riboprobes and ribonuclease A treatment after hybridization in 0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid without NaCl. Posi-tive controls consisted of in situ hybridization with anti-sense riboprobes for glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 GAD67 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF . For each animal, a series of sections was also stained with thionin for cytoarchitecture. GABA immunocytochemistry For GABA immunocytochemistry or double labeling of GABA immunoreactivity and GABABR1 mRNA, sections were rinsed twice in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 before being placed in 5% normal goat serum plus 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 for 1 hour at room temperature. They were then incubated for 12 hours at room temperature in an affinity-purified, rabbit anti-GABA serum Sigma, St. Louis, MO 1 2,000 dilution and washed in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 . For GABA immunoperoxidase, subsequent processes followed instructions supplied with the avidin biotinylated-peroxidase complex ABC kit from Vector Laboratories Burlingame, CA . Peroxidase activity was visualized by H2O2 0.01% and diaminobenzidine tetrahy-drochloride DABÂ·4HCl, 0.05% that gave rise to a brown-ish deposit at the site of GABA immunoreactivity. For GABA immunofluorescence, bound antibody was revealed by goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein Vector Laboratories 1 100 that yielded green fluorescence in GABA positive cells. For control reactions of GABA immunocytochemistry, the primary antibody was replaced by equal volume of normal rabbit serum. Double labeling For studying the distribution of GABABR1 mRNA signal in GABA neurons, a sequential double-labeling procedure was carried out on the same histologic sections to visualize first GABABR1a, GABABR1b or GABABR1p mRNA signals by in situ hybridization histochemistry and then GABA immunoreactivity by immunocytochemistry. As with any double-or multiple-labeling techniques, there exists the possibility of masking of one reaction by the other s and there were those cells that were marginally ambiguously positive for one marker or the other therefore, their identity as single-or double-labeled cells could not be definitely resolved. These issues were dealt with in the present study as follows First, in addition to a nonfluores-cent double-labeling technique that used NBT-BCIP for revelation of GABABR1 mRNAs and DAB H2O2 for GABA immunoreactivity, a fluorescent double-labeling procedure was carried out by using the red fluorescentAP reaction for visualization of GABABR1 mRNAs and then immunofluo-rescence for GABA. Preparations from fluorescent double-labeling experiments were compared with those from nonfluorescent double labeling to take the advantages of both methods and to cross-verify the results. Second, in addition to conventional microscope, Bio-Rad MRC600 laser scanning confocal microscope Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA was used to analyze fluorescent double-labeled materi- als to ascertain the identity of individual cells. Finally, only those cells with discernible nuclei were considered for drawing conclusions on the coexistence of GABA and Data analysis Both fluorescent and nonfluorescent histologic prepara-tions were observed under a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope. Fluorescent histochemical materials were further ana-lyzed and imaged by a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope. Levels of hybridization signals for GABABR1 mRNAs in various brain structures were esti-mated by intensity of NBT-BCIP reaction products or fluorescence. Hybridization signals with antisense probes in medial habenular nucleus or Purkinje cells for GABABR1b and GABABR1p were denoted as very strong 1111, very high levels and background hybridization similar to that with sense control probes as negative -. Intermediate intensities were designated successively as strong 111, high levels , medium 11, medium levels , weak 1, low levels , and very weak or marginal 6, very low levels . Initial ratings of relative signal levels in various structures were carried out independently by two investigators and wherever disagreements arose, a third investigator was called upon to verify the results. Low-magnification images of nonfluorescent prepara-tions were photomicrographed first and then digitized with a Nikon LS-4500AF film scanner from negative films. High magnification photomicrographs were grabbed di-rectly from the microscope to a Macintosh G3 computer by means of a digital color image acquisition system Sony DXC-950 3CCD color video camera, Scion CG-7 color image grabber and Scion Image 1.62 software . Figures were prepared from digitized images by using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and printed on a full-color digital printer Fujix Pictography 3000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan . For best printouts, the original image resolutions were scaled to 320 or 400 pixels per inch with Adobe Photoshop software. DISCUSSION The present study demonstrated widespread expression of GABABR1 receptor gene but differential distributions of the 1a and 1b mRNA variants in a variety of brain structures and neuronal cell types. GABA neurons of different areal origins and cell types expressed very differ-ently the GABABR1a and GABABR1b variants. Widespread availability of GABABR-mediated inhibition? GABABR1 mRNAs were expressed by surprisingly nu-merous neuronal cell types throughout the CNS. Although their levels varied considerably in different cell types and CNS structures, these results may still suggest that the GABAB receptor-mediated mechanisms are widely dispos-able to a variety of neuronal cell types and CNS structures. This corroborated previous data from molecular biological, electrophysiological, pharmacologic, receptor binding auto-radiographic as well as recent immunocytochemical works on GABABRs in a variety of brain structures and cell types. The present results of strong GABAB1 receptor gene expression in the medial habenular nucleus, dorsal thala-mus, and cerebellar Purkinje cells conform to previous results by receptor binding, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry Bowery et al., 1987 Chu et al., 1990 Knott et al., 1993 Turgeon and Albin, 1993 Kaup-mann et al., 1997, 1998b Munoz et al., 1998 Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999 Fritschy et al., 1999 Lu et al., 1999 . GABABR-mediated physiological and pharmacologic ef- fects have been described in many neural structures and cell types in spinal dorsal horn, cerebellum, substantia nigra, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and neocor-tex, in line with the present findings of widespread expres-sion of GABABR1 mRNA variants in the CNS Bowery et al., 1980 Newberry and Nicoll, 1984, 1985 Andrade et al., 1986 Howe et al., 1987 Connors et al., 1988 Soltesz et al., 1989a Hausser and Yung, 1994 Misgeld et al., 1995 Davies and Collingridge, 1996 Mouginot and Gahwiler, 1996 Deisz, 1997 Isaacson and Hille, 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . However, it has been shown that in heterologous mammalian expression systems GABABR1 subunit alone could not fully function as a mature receptor. A GABABR2 receptor subunit has been cloned recently, and heterodimer-ization of the GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits appears to be necessary for the assembly of a fully functional GABAB receptor Jones et al., 1998 Kaupmann et al., 1998a White et al., 1998 Kuner et al., 1999 . Low-level expression of GABABR1 mRNA has also been detected in peripheral organs Castelli et al., 1999 . It remains to be seen whether expression products of the GABABR1 vari-ants serve functions other than mediating late IPSP and auto-heteroinhibition of transmitter release. In general, the present results on the distribution of GABABR1 mRNAs agree well with that of GABABR1 immunoreactivities Koulen et al., 1998 Malitschek et al., 1998 Fritschy et al., 1999 Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999 . The lack of detectable GABABR1b mRNAexpression in the caudate putamen, thalamic reticular nucleus, and most brain stem structures, as shown in the present study, is reflected by a negative immunostaining thereof Fritschy et al., 1999 . However, in contrast to the present results of stronger GABABR1a hybridization signals in most CNS structures, Western blotting results suggest GABABR1b as a dominant variant in the adult rat brain Malitschek et al., 1998 Fritschy et al., 1999 Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999 . This discrepancy may arise from the fact that mRNA levels do not always reflect the synthesis of protein or the functional relevance of the gene Tecott et al., 1994 see Lu et al., 1999 for further discussions . More impor-tantly, it should be noted that sequence information spe-cific for GABABR1b is only 140 bp nucleotides. The relative low GABABR1b signal levels were likely to be attributed to the short length and very low U content of GABABR1b antisense probe U contents of GABABR1a, 1p, and 1b antisense probes were 76, 98, and 8, respectively . Thus, if one digoxigenin-11-UTP is incorporated out of every five probe uracil bases, each copy of GABABR1b antisense probe had on average 1.6 digoxigenin molecules, whereas each copy of GABABR1a and GABABR1p antisense probe might include 15.2 and 19.6 digoxigenin molecules, respec-tively. Considering the amplifying effect by anti-digoxi-genin antibody, the difference could be even bigger in number of bound alkaline phosphatase molecules per mRNA copy between GABABR1a 1p and GABABR1b. Fur-ther complicated by a nonlinear correlation between inten-sity of AP reaction deposits and the number of bound enzyme molecules or the duration of AP reaction, it may be misleading to directly compare the hybridization signal intensity for GABABR1b variant with those for the GABABR1a or 1p probe.Also for the same reason, low-level expression of GABABR1b mRNA in certain structures might have escaped detection. In addition to neurons, glia-like cells in the spinal white matter near the pia mater showed weak GABABR1a 1p mRNA expression. This result supports previous findings of GABABR-mediated effects in glial cells of the CNS Hosli and Hosli, 1990 Hosli et al., 1990 Fraser et al., 1994 . Expression of GABABR1 mRNA in glial cells, however, may be restricted to certain regions of the CNS and at a level much lower than in neurons because a previous study did not find significant GABABR1 gene expression in glial cells of hippocampal CA3 region Kaupmann et al., 1997 . The present study, as well, did not detect significant levels of GABABR1a, 1b, or 1p hybridization signal in glia cells in a majority of rat CNS structures other than the spinal white matter. It is unlikely that the widespread distribution of GABABR1a and 1p was an artifact caused by nonspecific hybridization or cross-hybridization of the probes with other types of mRNA. In a series of pilot experiments, probe concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 0.7 Î¼g ml for GABABR1a and GABABR1p were tested. Although probe concentrations above 0.4 Î¼g ml gave rise to certain back-ground staining for GABABR1p and strong Purkinje cell positivity for GABABR1a hybridization, probe concentra-tions ranging from 0.07â0.3 Î¼g ml produced consistent hybridization patterns for different brain structures and cell types. In addition, hybridization with sense control probes gave no positive signal except for the very weak hybridization for GABABR1b sense probe in the hippocam-pus. Finally, the present results on the distribution of the two mRNA variants in the cerebellar cortex agree with recently published data in this structure Kaupmann et al., 1998b . Differential expression of GABABR1 mRNA variants in GABA neurons As illustrated schematically in Figure 14, four expres-sion profiles of GABABR1a and or GABABR1b mRNA variants were distinguished in different GABA neurons. Many GABA neurons in the neocortex, hippocampus and septum expressed both GABABR1a and GABABR1b vari-ants. This finding is in strong contrast to GABAneurons in most subcortical structures. GABA neurons in thalamic reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, cau-date putamen, and GABAergic stellate basket cells in the cerebellar cortex hybridized mainly for GABABR1a anti-sense probe without detectable GABABR1b mRNA signal. Cerebellar Purkinje cells showed mainly GABABR1b mRNA expression. Finally, GABA neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed little expression of GABABR1 mRNA variants. Presynaptic GABABR-mediated autoinhibition of GABA release has been extensively studied and many important neurophysiological and pathologic processes such as noci-ception, use-dependent depression of inhibition, LTP, and epileptogenesis have been associated with this self-controlling mechanism Floran et al., 1988 Giralt et al., 1990 Seabrook et al., 1991 Morishita and Sastry, 1995 Bonanno et al., 1997 for reviews, see Bowery, 1997 Deisz, 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . GABABR-mediated postsynap-tic responses in GABA neurons have been less well charac-terized. Nevertheless, this disinhibitory mechanism by other GABA neurons or by recurrent collaterals of the GABA neurons themselves would also reduce GABAergic inhibitory output. Thus, activation of GABABR-mediated events in GABA neurons, either pre-or postsynaptic, would cause increased excitation of the integrated net-work, contrary to the effects of GABABR activation in excitatory neurons. The present findings suggest that the GABABR-medi-ated late IPSP and presynaptic autoinhibition of GABA release are differentially disposable to different GABA neurons. Those GABAneurons in the dorsal lateral genicu- late nucleus seemed lacking both mechanisms, in sharp contrast to most GABA neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus. In the context of these results, it is interest-ing to note that little GABABR-mediated responses have been detected in the intrinsic GABAergic interneurons of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of both cats and rats Pape and McCormick, 1995 Williams et al., 1996 . These interneurons, capable of firing trains of action potentials at a frequency exceeding 500 Hz in the cat, seemingly use alternative mechanisms, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, for modulating their capability to gate the transmission of visual information from retina to visual cortex McCormick and Pape, 1988 Pape and McCormick, 1995 . The GABABR1a-positive GABAneurons such as those in the striatum, thalamic reticular nucleus, and cerebellar stellate basket cells may also have physiological and phar-macologic properties very different from the GABA neu-rons in the cerebral cortex that expressed both GABABR1a and GABABR1b, or from cerebellar Purkinje cells that mainly expressed GABABR1b. It has been shown previ-ously that GABAB autoreceptors in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord represent pharmacologically distinct receptor subtypes Bonanno and Raiteri, 1993a . In view of the proposition that the two variants might be differentially located to axon terminals and somatodendritic domains of neurons see below , it remains to be determined how these findings relate to the functions of individual GABA neuron cell types and to their positioning in the integrated neural network. Margeta-Mitrovic and coworkers 1999 have found very few neurons that coexpressed GABABR1 immunoreactiv-ity and glutamic acid decarboxylase-67, in contrast to the present results showing expression of either or both of the GABABR1a and 1b mRNA variants in GABA neurons of most CNS structures. It remains unknown whether this discrepancy with the present results is caused by ex-tremely low level of GABABR1 mRNA translation, limited sensitivity of the antibody, or unrecognized GABABR vari-ants subunits in GABAneurons. Of particular relevance to the last point, for example, the antibody used by Margeta-Mitrovic et al. 1999 would not be able to detect the recently cloned GABABR1d Isomoto et al., 1998 . The present GABABR1b antisense probe, in contrast, would also hybridize with GABABR1c and 1d mRNA variants as the two share the same 58 end with GABABR1b Isomoto et al., 1998 . mRNA variants for receptor subtypes? The differential but partly overlapping expression of the two mRNA variants in various neuronal cell types and brain structures as shown in the present study, may contribute to the production of diverse subtypes of GABAB receptors. In line with this molecular diversity, variable physiological and pharmacologic profiles of GABABR ago-nist and antagonist actions have been demonstrated previ-ously in different CNS structures and cell types for reviews see, Bowery, 1997 Deisz, 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . However, the differential and variable expression patterns of GABABR1a and GABABR1b mRNA variants in both GABA and non-GABA neurons deny the possibility of separation of each variant into either GABA or non-GABA category. Differences in intracellular signal transduction cascades and effector systems may greatly enhance the functional heterogeneity and specificity derived from varia- tions in GABABR variant expression in different neuronal cell types. It has been recently proposed for the cerebellar cortex and retina that GABABR1a and GABABR1b variants might target pre-and postsynaptic GABABR subtypes, respec-tively Bettler et al., 1998 Kaupmann et al., 1998b Zhang et al., 1998 . Although the present study showed diverse patterns of expression of the two variants in the central nervous system, a detailed correlation of the present data with previous electrophysiological and pharmacologic stud-ies seems to extend the postulation to several other brain regions. The present study demonstrated, for example, the predominant GABABR1a expression in the striatum, ven-tral lateral geniculate nucleus, and the thalamic reticular nucleus. In the same brain regions, electrophysiological studies have failed to detect significant late IPSPs medi-ated by postsynaptic GABABRs Soltesz et al., 1989b Calabresi et al., 1991 Crunelli and Leresche, 1991 Nisen-baum et al., 1993 Ulrich and Huguenard, 1996 Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 1997 . Thus, it seemed conceivable that the mature translation product of GABABR1a mRNA in neurons of these structures was mainly for locations at presynaptic axon terminals. Both pre-and postsynaptic GABABR-mediated events have been demonstrated for the neocortex, hippocampus, and most dorsal thalamic nuclei Bowery, 1997 Deisz, 1997 Bettler et al., 1998 . Again, this agrees with the present findings of coexpression of the two variants by these structures. In accordance with the present results showing abundant expression of GABABR1b and very weak expression of GABABR1a mRNAby cerebel-lar Purkinje cells, previous studies have reported high levels of postsynaptic GABABRs on Purkinje cell dendrites in molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex and low levels of presynaptic GABABRs on Purkinje axon terminals in deep cerebellar nuclei Bowery et al., 1987 Chu et al., 1990 Turgeon and Albin, 1993 Morishita and Sastry, 1995 Mouginot et al., 1998 . Likewise, it may be deduced that most brain stem and spinal neuronal cell types, which mainly expressed the GABABR1a variant as shown in the present study, would manifest primarily a presynaptic GABABR-mediated effect. Except in the retina, no definite evidence has been presented for presynaptic GABABR1 immunoreactivity, either on GABAor non-GABAergic axon terminals, despite the vast number of electrophysiological reports on the matter. A direct immunohistochemical demonstration of GABABR1a peptide distribution in the CNS, for example, has not been possible because of the lack of suitable specific antibodies Koulen et al., 1998 Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999 Fritschy et al., 1999 . In view of the recent cloning of GABABR1c 1d and the possibility of other uniden-tified GABABR1 variants, the subtraction strategy GABABR1p 2 GABABR1b 5 GABABR1a distribution as used by Fritschy and coworkers 1999 is no longer ten-able. Because peptides are mostly synthesized in the cell bodies and subsequently transported to their final destina-tions, immunoreactivity detected in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites might represent immature, pre-assembling forms of the receptor subunit and, therefore, could not rule out that the functioning form is located at axon terminals. It awaits further studies, especially those at electron microscopic level by using variant-specific antibodies, to resolve the veracity of the postulation. RESULTS All GABABR1a, GABABR1b, or GABABR1p mRNA-positive stainings were located in the cell bodies. Many cells in a majority of neural structures were GABABR1 mRNA positive, but levels of mRNA signals in different cells varied to a large extent. Neurons in the medial habenular nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cells showed the strongest hybridization for GABABR1p riboprobe. Marked differences in the distributions of GABABR1a and GABABR1b mRNA variants were observed in many brain structures, with some neuronal cell types expressing nei-ther and others expressing either or both. Different sub-types of GABA neurons were distinguished based on their possession or lack of GABABR1a and or GABABR1b mRNA signals. Table 1 summarizes relative levels of in situ hybridization signals for GABABR1a, GABABR1b, or GABABR1p mRNA variant in major brain structures cell types. It should be noted that GABABR1b antisense probe might produce a hybridization signal of lower intensity by one order of magnitude in comparison with GABABR1a and GABABR1p because of its short length and extremely low probability of incorporating digoxigenin-11-UTP see Discussion section . Any correlation between staining in- tensity and relative mRNA levels for GABABR1a 1p was not directly applicable to that for GABABR1b. Also for this reason, the levels of GABABR1b mRNA expression in the CNS as presented in the present study may represent an underestimation. Although intensity of hybridization sig-nals in sections from different animals slightly varied, its relative ratings among different brain structures in indi-vidual animals kept consistent. GABABR1b sense control probe yielded a very weak hybridization signal in the pyramidal cell layer of hippo-campal CA1â3 and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus Fig. 1B . Other CNS structures did not show any detect-able hybridization other than a very faint background staining. Hybridization with sense control probes for GABABR1a and GABABR1p did not give rise to positive signal above background in any CNS structures Fig. 1A . Posthybridization treatment of sections with ribonuclease A at low salt concentration also resulted in loss of positive hybridization signals. Neocortex Many neurons across all neocortical layers were GAB-ABR1 mRNA positive. Figure 2 compares the expression pattern of GABABR1a Fig. 2A and GABABR1p Fig. 2B in the primary somatosensory cortex. Left panels in Figure 3 illustrates GABABR1b hybridization in different layers of the motor cortex. In layer I, scattered neurons showed medium levels of GABABR1a 1p mRNA, but only a few neurons in this layer were weakly positive for GABABR1b mRNA. In layers II and III, hybridization signals for GABABR1a 1p variant were medium to high in many neurons of variable sizes, but those for GABABR1b were low to marginal. Among different neocortical areas, layers II-III neurons of the temporal, occipital, and the barrel cortex showed more pronounced hybridization than other areas. Hybridization signals in layer IV neurons were generally weak for GABABR1a 1p and very weak to unobservable for GABABR1b mRNA. In the barrel cortex, neurons inside the barrels were visibly weaker in their hybridization signal for GABABR1a and GABABR1p Fig. 2 . Layer V pyramidal neurons, especially those of the motor cortex, showed the strongest hybridization of all neocortical neurons for GABABR1a, 1b, or 1p probe, but hybridization signals in neurons of smaller sizes in layer V were gener-ally medium to low for GABABR1a 1p and low to below detection for GABABR1b mRNA. mRNA levels in most layer VI neurons were low for GABABR1a 1p and low to marginal for GABABR1b Figs. 2A,B, 3A,C,E . As revealed by fluorescent double labeling and illus-trated in Figure 4, a majority of GABA neurons in the neocortex expressed GABABR1a 1p. Many neocortical GABA neurons, especially those in deep layers, also dis-played low to medium levels of GABABR1b mRNA Fig. 3AâF . In layer I, virtually all GABABR1a 1p-positive neurons were GABAergic. Some GABA neurons in layer I also showed low levels of GABABR1b mRNA expression. GABA neurons in layers IIâVI were scattered among non-GABAergic GABABR1 mRNA positive neurons. Those in layers II to IV expressed variable levels of GABABR1a 1p and very low to indiscernible GABABR1b mRNA. Most GABA neurons in layers V and VI had weak to medium GABABR1a, 1b, or 1p mRNA expression Figs. 3AâF, 4AâD . Same results were obtained from nonfluorescent double-labeling experiments data not shown . Hippocampus and septum Pyramidal neurons of CA1â3 expressed strong GABABR1a and medium GABABR1b mRNA with rela-tively higher levels of expression for the latter variant in CA1 than in CA2â3. GABABR1p expression represented the summation of GABABR1a and GABABR1b mRNA variants in that pyramidal neurons in CA1 showed more prominent hybridization signals than in CA2â3. Granule cells of the dentate gyrus expressed medium levels of GABABR1a 1p and low levels of GABABR1b mRNA. Scat-tered neurons in strata oriens, radiatum, and lacunosum moleculare of CA1â3 and molecular, polymorphic layers of the dentate gyrus exhibited medium levels of GABABR1a 1p mRNA. Most of them were also weakly positive for GABABR1b mRNA Fig. 5AâC . GABA immunocytochemistry revealed a distinct band of dense GABA axon terminals in stratum radiatum at the proximal dendritic segment of CA3 pyramidal cells Fig. 6A,B . On double-labeling preparations, most GABA neu-rons stained positive for GABABR1a 1p, but a few of them in strata oriens and pyramidalis displayed little GABABR1a 1p hybridization signal. Both GABA and GABABR1a 1p mRNA levels varied to a certain extent in hippocampal GABA neurons Fig. 6AâD . GABABR1b sig-nals were also observed in a large proportion of hippocam-pal GABA neurons Fig. 7AâD . GABABR1a and GABABR1b coexpressed in the septum. Although there existed considerable variation of GAB-ABR1 mRNAstaining intensity among individual neuronal cells, neurons in the dorsal lateral septal nucleus showed stronger GABABR1a, GABABR1b as well as GABABR1p mRNA staining than those in ventral or medial septal nuclei Fig. 8A . Panels B to G in Figure 8 show fluorescent double labeling of GABABR1 mRNA variants and GABA immunoreactivity in the septum. All GABA neurons in the septum appeared positive for GABABR1a, GABABR1b, and GABABR1p mRNA. Thalamus and caudate putamen Neurons in a majority of dorsal thalamic nuclei dis-played medium to high levels of hybridization signals for both GABABR1a and GABABR1b mRNA. Thalamic reticu-lar nucleus and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, how-ever, lacked significant hybridization signal for GABABR1b under the present experimental condition. As a result, GABABR1p mRNA levels in these nuclei were markedly lower than those in other thalamic nuclei, although levels of GABABR1a hybridization signals were comparable to those in the latter. Among different nuclei in the dorsal thalamus, mRNA levels varied in a similar pattern for GABABR1a, 1b, and GABABR1p. Hybridization signals for all three cRNA probes were visibly stronger in neurons of anterodorsal, mediodorsal, laterodorsal, medial genicu-late, and dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei than in other thalamic subdivisions. Ventrolateral nucleus exhibited slightly higher signal intensities than the neighboring ventral posteromedial and ventral posterolateral nuclei. Neurons in intralaminar nuclei displayed weaker hybrid-ization signals Fig. 9AâF, results from anterodorsal and medial geniculate nuclei not illustrated . Upper panels in Figure 10 show fluorescent double labeling of GABABR1p mRNAhybridization A and GABA immunoreactivity B in thalamic reticular nucleus. All neurons in this structure seemed GABAergic and ex-pressed low to medium levels of GABABR1a 1p mRNA without detectable GABABR1b Figs. 9AâC, 10A,B . In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, GABA neurons were smaller in size than the surrounding non-GABAergic neurons, showed strong GABAimmunoreactivity, but gave only marginal GABABR1a and no GABABR1b or GABABR1p mRNA signal Fig. 11AâF . GABA neurons in ventral lateral geniculate nucleus had medium levels of hybridization signals for GABABR1a and GABABR1p data not shown . Most other thalamic nuclei lacked significant number of GABA neurons. In the caudate putamen and globus pallidus, many neurons expressed low to medium levels of GABABR1a and GABABR1p mRNA, but GABABR1b hybridization signal was mostly not observed. Scattered GABA neurons in the caudate putamen and globus pallidus contained weak to moderate levels of GABABR1a 1p mRNA but expressed no apparent GABABR1b mRNA Fig. 10C,D . Cerebellum Different cell types in the cerebellar cortex had their unique patterns of expression of GABABR1 mRNA vari-ants. Stellate basket cells in the molecular layer showed weak GABA immunoreactivity, weak GABABR1a, very weak GABABR1p and undetectable GABABR1b mRNA expression. Purkinje cells were weakly GABAimmunoreac-tive, had strong signals for GABABR1b and GABABR1p, but very weak signals for GABABR1a mRNA. Both Golgi and granule cells showed no signals for GABABR1b mRNA. Golgi cells had medium levels of GABA immunoreactivity and GABABR1a 1p mRNAs. The granule cells were nega-tive for GABA, but weakly positive for GABABR1a 1p mRNA Fig. 12AâF . Although Purkinje cells showed very weak hybridization signal for GABABR1a at probe concentrations used in the present study, they did show medium to strong hybridiza-tion for GABABR1a at higher probe concentrations .0.4 Î¼g ml as demonstrated in a series of pilot experiments designed to test the suitable probe concentration and to optimize the specificity and sensitivity of the technique. This positivity for GABABR1a at higher probe concentra-tions was arbitrarily defined as ââfalse positive.ââ However, together with the observation that hybridization signal for GABABR1a was stronger than that for GABABR1p in the stellate basket cells, these phenomena might have re-sulted from the possible existence of truncated forms of GABABR1a or other unidentified GABABR1 mRNA vari-ants subunits in the cerebellar cortex. In the deep cerebellar nuclei, two populations of neurons could be distinguished according to their size, GABA immunoreactivity, and GABABR1 mRNAsignals. The rela-tively large neurons, which lacked GABA immunoreactiv-ity, were moderately GABABR1a and GABABR1p mRNA positive. The small GABAergic neurons were weakly GABABR1a and GABABR1p mRNApositive. No GABABR1b mRNA-positive neurons were detected in the deep cerebel-lar nuclei data not illustrated . Other CNS structures Low to medium levels of GABABR1a 1p hybridization signals were observed in various hypothalamic nuclei, with relatively strong signal in the supraoptic nucleus Fig. 13A,B . GABABR1b hybridization in most cases could not be ascertained in the hypothalamus because of low signal. GABA neurons in the hypothalamus showed low to medium levels of GABABR1a 1p mRNA. Neurons in both the pars compacta and reticulata of substantia nigra hybridized at variable signal intensities for GABABR1a and GABABR1p Fig. 13C . Weak expres-sion of GABABR1b mRNA was only detected in substantia nigra pars compacta. Many neurons in various brainstem structures and all laminae of the spinal cord gray matter showed low to medium levels of GABABR1a GABABR1p mRNA. Some cells in the spinal cord white matter also displayed weak GABABR1a 1p hybridization signal. Fig-ure 13D shows the superior colliculus hybridized for GABABR1a mRNA. Although detected at low levels in the motoneurons of various cranial nerve nuclei and of lamina IX of spinal ventral horn, GABABR1b mRNA expression in most other structures of the brainstem and spinal cord could not be definitely established due to poor hybridiza-tion signal. Low to medium levels of GABABR1a 1p hybridization signal were detected in many GABA neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord structures including the superior and inferior colliculi, nucleus of the solitary tract, the superfi-cial laminae of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and laminae II-III of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Figure 13E and F illustrate such an example of GABABR1p expression in GABA neurons in laminae II-III of the spinal cord dorsal horn.

A subset of these cells are labeled in a Golgi-like manner by Parvalbumin PV immunohistochemistry. Recently, we have shown that the overwhelming majority of axon terminals contacting these PV-immunoreactive neurons form asymmetric synapses. The present study was undertaken to identify the source s of these inputs. Since previous work had revealed that thalamic axons form very few synapses on BL interneurons ,1% , we focused on cortical and intra-amygdaloid inputs. Iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin or biotinylated dextran amine were performed in various cortical fields in cats perirhinal, entorhinal, pre infralimbic cortices and monkeys orbitofrontal region or in the BL amygdaloid nucleus in cats. These injections resulted in a large number of anterogradely labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses in the BL complex. Following cortical injections, numerous anterogradely labeled terminals were found in the vicinity of PV-immunoreactive interneurons in the BL amygdala. However, only 1% of these terminals formed synaptic contacts with PV-immunoreactive profiles. In contrast, as many as 11% of the terminals contributed by the intranuclear axon collaterals of BL projection cells established synapses with PV-immunoreactive elements. Since the axon terminals of PV-immunoreactive interneurons are enriched in GABA and they exclusively form symmetric synapses, these results suggest that PV-immunoreactive interneurons are predominantly involved in feedback inhibition in the BL amygdaloid complex. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 496â508, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The amygdala plays a critical role in fear learning Davis, 1992 LeDoux, 1998 . The available data suggests that it can transfer the affective significance of noxious stimuli to other, coincident sensory events of the same or different modalities. As a result, neutral sensory stimuli can acquire the ability to elicit fear responses. The profuse intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala probably plays an essential role in this respect Krettek and Price, 1978 Smith and Pare Â´, 1994 Pareet Â´ al., 1995, Pitka Â¨nen et al., 1997 Pareand Â´ Smith, 1998 . Indeed, anatomical studies have revealed that thalamic and cortical afferents convey-ing sensory inputs of distinct modalities form a complex mosaic of termination zones in the amygdala reviewed in Russchen, 1986 . As these termination zones do not over-lap completely, the intra-and inter-nuclear projections of the amygdala may be required to relate the activity patterns occurring in non-overlapping sectors. However, to preserve the associative potential of this profuse intrinsic connectivity while preventing the emer-gence of epileptic events, the excitability of the amygdala must be tightly controlled. In keeping with this, physiologi-cal studies have emphasized the extremely low spontane-ous firing rates of amygdala projection neurons in unanes-thetized animals Gaudreau and Pare Â´, 1996 Pareand Â´ Gaudreau, 1996 Collins and Pare Â´, 1999 . Moreover, in vitro Rainnie et al., 1991 Washburn and Moises, 1992 and in vivo Lang and Pare Â´, 1997a,b intracellular studies have reported that afferent stimulation elicits large ampli-tude GABAergic inhibitory post-synaptic potentials in projection cells of the basolateral BL amygdaloid complex BL, lateral and basomedial nuclei . As lesions deafferenting the BL amygdala produce negli-gible decreases in the levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase Le Gal La Salle, 1978 , it is commonly believed that intrinsic GABAergic interneurons constitute the main source of inhibition in this nuclear group Carlsen, 1988 McDonald, 1985,1992a McDonald and Augustine, 1993 Pareand Â´ Smith, 1993 . These neurons, which account for 15% of the cells in the BL amygdala McDonald, 1992b , are morphologically and chemically heterogeneous Hall, 1972a Kamal and To Â¨mbo Â¨l, 1975 McDonald, 1992a . For example, small subsets 8â17% of GABAergic cells ex-press somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin or vasoactive intestinal peptide McDonald and Pearson, 1989 . Moreover, calcium binding proteins, such as parval-bumin PV , also co-localize with GABA, but in a much higher proportion of interneurons 50% McDonald and Baimbridge, 1990 . By contrast, very few, if any, BL projection cells express PV McDonald and Baimbridge, 1990 Pitka Â¨nen and Amaral, 1993 . Given the importance of inhibitory interneurons in controlling the excitability of BL projection cells, we have recently analyzed the synaptology of PV-immunoreactive interneurons Smith et al., 1998 and found that the overwhelming majority 94% of axon terminals contacting them formed asymmetric synapses. However, the source of these presumed excitatory inputs remained unidentified. The present study was undertaken to address this issue. Since thalamic inputs form very few ,1% synapses on interneurons Carlsen and Heimer, 1988 LeDoux et al., 1991 , we focused on their cortical and intra-amygdaloid inputs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and tissue processing Eighteen cats anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine 11 mg kg and 2 mg kg, respec-tively received injections of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglu-tinin PHA-L, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA 2.5% in phosphate buffer 0.01M, pH 8.0 in various cortical regions or the BL amygdaloid nucleus Fig. 1, Table 1 . The depth of anesthesia was determined by monitoring hearth rate and muscle tone as well as corneal and toe-pinch reflexes. The surgery, anesthesia, and post-operative care were carried out in agreement with the ethics guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the National Institute of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Laval and Emory Universities. PHA-L was injected iontophoretically through glass micropipettes with a tip diameter ranging from 20â40 Î¼m. A 5â7 Î¼A positive current 7 seconds ON 7 seconds OFF cycle was applied during 20 minutes to deliver the tracer Gerfen and Sawchenko, 1984 . Ten to twelve days after the injections, the animals were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital Somnotol, 45 mg kg and perfused transcardially with 500â700 ml of a cold 4Â°C oxygenated perfusate containing in mM 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 3 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.4 CoCl2, 5 HEPES, and 15 dextrose. The tissue was then fixed by perfusing 2 liters of phosphate buffer PB 0.1 M, pH 7.4 containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaralde-hyde. Free aldehydes were washed out by perfusing 1 liter of cold PB 0.1M, pH 7.4 . After perfusion, the brain was cut in 10 mm transverse blocks, removed from the skull, stored in phosphate buff-ered saline PBS 0.01 M, pH 7.4 at 4Â°C and then cut in 60 Î¼m transverse sections with a vibrating microtome. A series of sections from each case was stained with thionin and mounted on gelatin-coated slides while the remaining sections were stored in PBS at 4Â°C until further immunocy-tochemical processing. In addition, two male adult rhesus monkeys, anesthe-tized with isoflurane, received unilateral iontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine BDA Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR 5% in distilled water in the orbitofron-tal cortex Brodmannâs areas 25 and 14c Carmichael and Price, 1994 . The survival time, perfusion, and brain sectioning procedures were identical to those described above for cats. Localization of anterograde tracers and PV immunoreactivity All sections were pre-treated with sodium borohydride 1% in PBS for 20 minutes and thoroughly washed in PBS before being processed to reveal axonal tracers and PV immunoreactivity for light and electron microscope analy-ses. Light microscopy. To reveal the injected and trans-ported PHA-L, sections containing the injection sites and or the amygdala were pre-incubated for 1 hour in 1% normal goat serum NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Then, they were incubated overnight at room temperature in a mixture of rabbit anti-PHA-L 1 1,000 Vector Laborato-ries, Burlingame, CA , 1% NGS, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. After three washes in PBS 10 minutes each , sec-tions were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgGs Vector Labs 1 200 in PBS 1% NGS 0.3% Triton X-100 for 90 minutes at room temperature followed by a 1 hour incubation in the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex solution ABC Vector Labs 1 100 in PBS 1% bovine serum albumin 0.3% Triton X-100 . They were then washed in PBS and TRIS buffer 0.05 M, pH 7.6 before being placed in a solution containing 3,38 diaminobenzidine tetrahydro-chloride DAB, 0.025% Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis, MO , 0.01 M Imidazole Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada , and 0.006% hydrogen peroxide for 10â15 minutes. After several washes in PBS, sections of the amygdala were preincubated for 1 hour at room tempera-ture in a solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% non-immune horse serum diluted in PBS and then incu-bated for 12â16 hours with mouse anti-PV antibodies Swant, Switzerland diluted 1 10,000 in PBS containing 1% normal horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 . The sections were then rinsed thrice in PBS and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature in biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgGs and ABC as described above. They were then washed twice in PBS and placed in a TRIS buffer containing DAB 0.025% , ammonium nickel sulfate Ni-DAB, 0.35% Fisher Scientific, Norcross, GA , and hydro-gen peroxide 0.0006% for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by extensive rinsing in PBS. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated and a coverslip was applied with Permount. In the cases where BDA was used as anterograde tracer, sections containing the injection sites and the amygdala were incubated for 12â16 hours at room temperature with ABC 1 100 dilution in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin BSA Sigma Chemical Company and processed with DAB see above . Then, PV immunoreactivity was revealed in amygdala sections and visualized with Ni-DAB as described above. Electron microscopy. Series of sections that included the amygdala were processed for the simultaneous visual-ization of the transported PHA-L or BDA and PV immuno-reactivity at the electron microscope level. To enhance the penetration of the antibodies and the ABC into the tissue, the sections were placed in a cryoprotectant solution PB, 0.05 M, pH 7.4, containing 25% sucrose and 10% glycerol for 20â30 minutes, and frozen at 280Â°C for 20 minutes. They were then thawed and washed many times in PBS before being processed to localize PHA-L or BDAwith DAB as described above, except that no Triton X-100 was used, and incubations with primary antibodies lasted for 48 hours at 4Â°C. Once the tracer had been revealed, the sections were processed to localize PV immunoreactivity with either tetramethylbenzidine TMB Sigma Chemical Company or benzidine dihydrochloride BDHC Sigma Chemical Company according to Llewellyn-Smith et al. 1993 and Levey et al. 1986 . Sections where PV was revealed with TMB were pro-cessed as follows. After incubations with antibodies and ABC, sections were washed many times in PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 and pre-incubated for 20 minutes in a TMB solution containing 5 ml of 1% amonium paratungstate, 1.25 ml of 0.2% TMB in absolute ethanol, 1 ml of 0.4% NH4Cl, and 1 ml of 20% D-glucose in 100 ml of PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 . The reaction was initiated by adding 10% glucose oxidase to a fresh TMB solution. The reaction was terminated after 7â10 minutes by extensive washings in PB 0.1M, pH 6.0 . In agreement with the method developed by Rye et al. 1984 , the TMB reaction product was stabilized by incubat-ing sections for 5â7 minutes in a solution containing 100 mg of DAB, 1 ml of 0.4% NH4Cl, 1 ml of 20% D-glucose, 2 ml of 1% CoCl2 and 100 Î¼l of glucose oxidase in 100 ml of PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 . The sections were then washed many times in PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 before being processed for electron microscopy. Sections where PV was revealed with BDHC were washed three to five times in PB 0.01 M, pH 6.8 before being pre-incubated in a BDHC solution prepared accord-ing to Levey et al. 1986 . After a 10 minutes pre-incubation, the reaction was initiated by adding hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 0.005% in a fresh BDHC solution. The reaction was terminated after 5â7 minutes by extensive washings in PB 0.01 M, pH 6.8 before processing for electron microscopy. Control experiments. As controls, series of sections were processed to reveal the anterograde tracers with DAB and then incubated in solutions where the PV antiserum was replaced by 1% non-immune mouse serum. The other steps of the immunocytochemical reactions as well as the TMB or BDHC reactions were the same as those described above. In these experiments where the PV antiserum was omitted, only DAB-labeled axon terminals could be seen. Processing for Electron Microscopy The sections were washed in PB 0.1 M, pH 6.0 for TMB or 0.01 M, pH 6.8 for BDHC before being post-fixed in osmium tetroxide 1% solution in PB for 20 minutes. Then, they were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol and propylene oxide. Uranyl acetate was added to the 70% ethanol 30 minutes to improve the contrast in the electron microscope. The sections were then embedded in resin Durcupan ACM, Fluka EM Sciences, Fort Washing-ton, PA on microscope slides and put in an oven for 48 hours at 60Â°C. After detailed examination in the light microscope, regions of the amygdala where anterogradely labeled fibers overlapped with PV-immunoreactive neu-rons were cut out from the slides and glued on the top of resin blocks using cyanoacrylate glue. Serial ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut T ultramicro-tome and collected on Pioloform-coated single slots copper grids. They were stained with lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss EM10C electron microscope. Analysis of Material The synaptic relationships between anterogradely la-beled terminals and PV-containing interneurons were analyzed at the electron microscope level in dense areas of overlap in the lateral, BL, and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei. In order to ensure that sections contained both DAB-and TMB BDHC-labeled elements, only the most superficial sections of the blocks were selected for electron microscope analysis. Once an anterogradely labeled termi-nal was found in the vicinity of a TMB BDHC-labeled structure, it was followed in 2â4 serial sections to verify the possibility of synaptic contact between these elements. To compare the relative frequency of intrinsic versus cortical inputs to PV-immunoreactive interneurons, the number of anterogradely labeled terminals in contact with either labeled or unlabeled post-synaptic targets were counted in ultrathin sections that contained TMB-or BDHC-labeled structures. To ensure that the examined areas contained PV-immunoreactive neurons, only those cortical or intrinsic boutons that were located less than 2 Î¼m away from TMB BDHC-labeled elements were consid-ered for the quantitative analysis shown in Figure 7. This approach was used to ensure that we considered only anterogradely labeled boutons that had the opportunity to interact with PV-immunoreactive elements, thus reducing false negative data caused by heterogeneous penetration of the antibodies or reagents in the tissue. DISCUSSION The present study was undertaken to identify the origin of the excitatory synaptic inputs to PV-immunoreactive inhibitory interneurons of the BL amygdaloid complex. Whereas only 1% of cortical terminals formed synaptic contacts on PV-immunoreactive elements, 11% of bou-tons contributed by the intranuclear collaterals of BL projection neurons established synaptic contacts on this class of interneurons. In the following account, we will consider these observations in light of previous anatomical findings and speculate on their significance for the genesis of inhibition in the BL amygdala. Synaptology of inhibitory interneurons of the BL amygdaloid complex Little electron microscope data is available regarding the synaptic inputs to identified inhibitory interneurons of the BL amygdaloid complex. In part, this is due to the fact that GABA and GAD antibodies only label the soma and proximal dendrites of interneurons Carlsen, 1988 . Fortu-nately, PV immunohistochemistry labels a subset of GABAergic interneurons 50% McDonald and Baim-bridge, 1990 in a Golgi-like manner. Taking advantage of this, we have recently analyzed the synaptology of PV-immunoreactive interneurons Smith et al., 1998 . This study revealed that an unusually high proportion of synap-tic contacts found on these interneurons are of the asym-metric variety Smith et al., 1998 , a type of synaptic specialization usually associated with excitatory synapses Colonnier, 1981 . However, the source s of this massive excitatory input remained unidentified. On the basis of previous tract-tracing studies, three main candidates emerged the dorsal thalamus, the cerebral cortex, and the intra-amygdaloid axon collaterals of projection neurons Russchen, 1986 Amaral, 1992 . Regarding the first candidate structure, two studies have examined the projections of dorsal thalamic nuclei to the BL amygdaloid complex at the electron microscope level Carlsen and Heimer, 1988 LeDoux et al., 1991 . Both studies revealed that thalamic terminals form asym-metric synaptic contacts almost exclusively $99% with dendritic spines. Since PV-containing interneurons are devoid of dendritic spines, these results imply that tha-lamic axons do not contribute significantly to their innerva-tion. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the articulation of cortical axons with immunohis-tochemically identified interneurons of the BL amygdala. Following anterograde tracer injections into various corti-cal areas, only 1% of labeled terminals contacted PV-immunoreactive elements. As was noted for thalamic inputs Carlsen and Heimer, 1988 LeDoux et al., 1991 , and in agreement with previous findings Hall, 1972b Brinley-Reed et al., 1995 , the preferential targets of cortical axons were dendritic spines and all cortical termi-nals formed asymmetric synapses in the BL amygdala. It is worth noting that 16% of cortical boutons synapsed on PV-immunonegative dendrites and somata, thus raising the possibility that some of these terminals contact other types of GABAergic interneurons. In contrast, a significant proportion of the excitatory terminals contributed by the intra-amygdaloid collaterals of projection cells 11% formed synaptic contacts with PV-immunoreactive interneurons in the cat BL. Hereafter, these axonal boutons will be termed ââintrinsicââ terminals for brevity. Although the percentage of intrinsic boutons ending on PV-immunoreactive cells may seem low, it should be remembered that GABAergic local-circuit cells account for 15% of BL amygdala neurons and that only 50% of those are PV-immunoreactive McDonald and Baimbridge, 1990 . Moreover, the dendritic arbor of local-circuit cells tends to be smaller than that of projection cells McDonald, 1992a Lang and Pare Â´, 1998 . Thus, by chance alone, one would expect that only a minority of terminals contributed by a contingent of axons would form synaptic contacts with PV-immunoreactive interneurons. As expected from these considerations and consistent with results of our previous study Pareet Â´ al., 1995 , the majority of intrinsic terminals contacted dendritic spines 77% . However, 11% ended on PV-immunonegative dendritic profiles, raising the possibil-ity that some of them may form synapses on other types of GABAergic interneurons. Although the proportion of terminals contacting PV-immunoreactive interneurons is much higher for intrinsic inputs than for cortical or thalamic afferents, it remains that an infinitesimal percentage of their excitatory inputs was labeled in our study. Two factors might explain this. First, our PHA-L injections in the BL nucleus probably labeled only a minor proportion of intrinsic terminals. Second, to insure that the DAB labeling reflected antero-grade transport of PHA-L along intra-amygdaloid path-ways rather than non-specific tracer uptake in the injec-tion site, we confined our electron microscope observations to sites that were clearly outside the PHA-L deposit. If BL projection cells mostly contact PV interneurons located close to their soma, then this precautionary measure would have greatly reduced the number of anterogradely labeled terminals in contact with PV-immunoreactive pro-cesses. In the future, these issues should be addressed by comparing the postsynaptic targets and presynaptic bou-tons of projection cells and interneurons using intracellu-lar injection of Neurobiotin coupled to immunohistochem-istry for various peptides. Although this approach is time-consuming, it is the only way to further our under-standing of the intra-amygdaloid microcircuitry. The contrasting proportion of intrinsic and cortical axon terminals forming synaptic contacts with PV-immunoreac-tive interneurons appears contrary to the widespread belief that axons tend to form synapses with all the potential targets present in their termination field White, 1989 . However, mounting evidence suggests that this idea is not always valid. In the striatum for instance, it was shown that thalamic axons preferentially contact striatal cells projecting to the internal rather than the external segment of the globus pallidus Sidibeand Â´ Smith, 1996 . Moreover, striatal cholinergic interneurons receive few cortical inputs compared to PV-immunoreactive interneu-rons Lapper and Bolam, 1992 Lapper et al., 1992 . PV-immunoreactive inhibitory interneurons generate feedback inhibition In our previous study Smith et al., 1998 , we showed that the axon terminals of PV-immunoreactive interneu-rons are enriched in GABA and that they exclusively form symmetric synapses. In light of these findings, the preva-lent innervation of PV-immunoreactive interneurons by terminals of intrinsic origin implies that this cell class is preferentially involved in the genesis of feedback inhibi-tion. Unless the intra-amygdaloid targets of thalamic and cortical axons vary with their exact origin or that another input, as yet unidentified, preferentially targets this class of interneurons, their involvement in feedforward inhibi-tion should be marginal. However, it is worth stressing that this conclusion only applies to PV-immunoreactive interneurons. Other subgroups of local-circuit cells may take part in different circuits as was found in the hippocam-pal formation reviewed in Freund and Buzsa Â´ki, 1996 . RESULTS To determine whether cortical and intra-amygdaloid afferents form synaptic contacts with PV-immunoreactive interneurons, iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracers PHA-L in cats and BDA in monkeys were performed at various sites known to contribute important projections to the BL amygdaloid complex. Figure 1 illus-trates representative examples of these injection sites and Table 1 summarizes the distribution of the anterograde labeling produced by these injections in the amygdala. Overall, the pattern of anterograde labeling was consis-tent with that described in previous studies. For example, injections in the cat infra-and or prelimbic cortex n59 Fig. 1A led to massive anterograde labeling in the BL nucleus Figs. 2,3 Russchen, 1982 , whereas injections in the perirhinal cortex n52 Fig. 1B predominantly labeled the lateral nucleus Russchen, 1982 Witter and Groenewe-gen, 1986 . Moreover, injections in the lateral entorhinal area of the cat n54 Fig. 1C , produced anterograde labeling in the BL nucleus and, to a lesser extent, in the lateral nucleus Russchen, 1982 Witter and Groenewegen, 1986 . In monkeys, BDA injections in the orbitofrontal cortex Fig. 1D led to massive anterograde labeling in the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus Bpc and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus ABmc Fig. 3A , in keeping with previous findings Freed-man et al., 1997 . In addition, the intercalated cell masses contained a moderate density of anterogradely labeled fibers and varicosities Table 1 . Distribution of PV immunoreactivity in the amygdala Overall, the distribution of PV immunoreactivity in the cat amygdala observed here Figs. 2, 3 was consistent with that described in our recent study Smith et al., 1998 . Briefly, the lateral, BL and basomedial nuclei contained a high density of PV-immunoreactive perikarya that lay among rich plexuses of PV-containing aspiny dendrites and terminal-like varicosities Smith et al., 1998 . The neuropil staining was particularly intense in the BL nucleus. In contrast, the central and medial amygdala nuclei displayed almost no PV immunoreactivity. The pattern of PV immunoreactivity in the monkey amygdala was similar to that previously reported by Pitka Â¨nen andAmaral 1993 and strikingly resembled that observed in cats Smith et al., 1998 . Indeed, the basal, accessory basal and shell of the lateral nucleus were the most intensely labeled amygdaloid structures whereas the central and medial nuclei were almost completely devoid of PV immunoreactivity Pitka Â¨nen and Amaral, 1993 . For our electron microscope observations to be valid, anterogradely labeled fibers and PV-immunoreactive pro-cesses had to overlap extensively. To determine whether this was the case, we visualized anterogradely-labeled fibers and PV-immunoreactive neurons at the light micro-scope level, using chromogens that yield reaction products of different colors see Material and Methods . Whereas PHA-L-and BDA-labeled fibers were revealed with DAB, resulting in a brown deposit, PV-immunoreactive pro-cesses were labeled with Ni-DAB, producing a dark blue reaction product. As a result, anterogradely labeled fibers could be distin-guished easily from PV-labeled elements Fig. 3 . In the BL complex of both cats and monkeys, large areas of overlap were found between the brown anterogradely labeled varicose fibers and the darkly stained PV-containing peri-karya and dendritic processes Fig. 3 . At high magnifica-tion, DAB-labeled varicosities were often found in apposi-tion to PV-containing dendrites arrowheads in Fig. 3C . To determine whether cortical terminals actually con-tacted PV-immunoreactive neurons, sections of the amyg-dala were prepared for electron microscope observations. The anterograde tracers were revealed with the electron-dense amorphous DAB reaction product, whereas PV-containing processes were visualized with TMB or BDHC, which led to filamentous or crystalline deposits, respec-tively see Figs. 5,6 . Only regions of the amygdala where anterogradely labeled fibers overlapped with PV-immuno-reactive neurons were examined. At the electron microscope level, the ultrastructural features and targets of cortical terminals n5250 were similar in cats in the lateral and basal amygdaloid nuclei and monkeys in the accessory basal nucleus . In both species, the diameter of cortical boutons ranged between 0.8 and 1.5 Î¼m, they contained a large density of round electron-lucent vesicles and formed asymmetric synapses almost exclusively with dendritic spines and distal den-drites Fig. 4 . In fact, contacts with dendritic spines accounted for 91% and 68% of cortical synapses observed in the basal and lateral nuclei, respectively. On the other hand, synapses with cell bodies and large proximal den-drites were not found in the BL and ABmc, but a few axo-somatic synapses 12% were encountered in the lat-eral nucleus after injections in the perirhinal cortex Fig. 4C . Another consistent feature that characterized the vari-ous cortical inputs to the cat and monkey amygdala was the rarity of synaptic connections with PV-immunoreac-tive neurons. Figure 5 shows typical examples of relation-ships between cortical boutons and PV-containing den-drites in cats and monkeys. As expected on the basis of light microscope observations Figs. 2,3, and 5A , numer-ous DAB-labeled cortical terminals were found in the vicinity of PV-immunoreactive dendrites but, when fol-lowed in serial sections, most formed asymmetric synapses with unlabeled dendrites or spines Fig. 5BâF . A single cortical terminal was found in direct synaptic contact with a PV-immunoreactive dendrite in the ABmc in monkey Fig. 5G and 2 in the cat BL complex, e.g., a total of 3 out of 250 cortical terminals or 1.2%. It should be emphasized that we considered only anterogradely-labeled terminals located within 2 Î¼m of PV-immunoreactive profiles to ensure that they had the ââopportunityââ to interact synapti-cally. Since none of our cortical injections produced significant labeling of synaptic inputs to PV-immunoreactive interneu-rons, PHA-L injections were placed in the cat BL nucleus to test the possibility that intranuclear amygdaloid connec-tions might provide excitatory afferents to this class of neurons. In agreement with previous findings Pareet Â´ al., 1995 Savander et al., 1995 , PHA-L injections that in-volved the central part of the BL nucleus produced dense anterograde labeling throughout most of the BL nucleus. The ultrastructural features and targets of intranuclear BL axons were analyzed in sectors of the BL nucleus located well outside the injection sites. At the electron microscope level, anterogradely labeled BL terminals n5115 displayed ultrastructural features typical of intra-amygdaloid glutamatergic boutons, as expected from previ-ous studies Smith and Pare Â´, 1994 Pareet Â´ al., 1995 , e.g., they were densely packed with small vesicles and formed asymmetric synapses, predominantly with dendritic spines 77.4% but also with dendrites of small caliber 22.6% . However, in contrast to cortical terminals, as many as 11.3% of BL boutons formed asymmetric synapses with PV-immunoreactive interneurons Figs. 6,7 , all of them with dendritic profiles. To ensure that this difference between cortical and intranuclear BL afferents was not due to an insufficient sampling, 2 times more cortical boutons than amygdaloid terminals were examined Fig. 7 . The difference between the proportion of cortical and intranuclear BL boutons in contact with PV-immunoreac-tive profiles was statistically significant x2-test P,0.01 .

Furthermore, we distinguished between relay cells and interneurons with post-embedding immunocytochemistry for GABA relay cells are GABA negative and interneurons are GABA positive . Onto relay cells, RL terminals contributed 7.1%, F terminals contributed 30.9%, and RS terminals contributed 62.0%. Onto interneurons, RL terminals contributed 48.7%, F terminals contributed 24.4%, and RS terminals contributed 26.9%. We also found that RL terminals included many more separate synaptic contact zones 9.1 6 1.6 than did F terminals 2.6 6 0.2 or RS terminals 1.02 6 0.02 . We used these data plus the calculation of overall percentages of each synaptic type to compute the relative percentage of each terminal type in the neuropil RL terminals represent 1.8%, F terminals represent 14.5%, and RS terminals represent 83.7%. We argue that this relative synaptic paucity is typical for driver inputs from retina , whereas modu-lator inputs all others require many more synapses to achieve their function. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 509â520, 2000. Â© 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat has been one of the most intensely studied regions of the brain. We now appreciate that this is no mere relay of retinal signals to cortex, but rather involves variable and dy-namically controlled alterations in the extent and prop-erties of the retinal signals that are relayed reviewed in Sherman and Guillery, 1996 Sherman and Koch, 1998 . To appreciate the neural basis of this dynamic relay process, we must have a still better understanding of geniculate cell and circuit properties. A starting point is to provide a fuller description with the electron mi-croscope of the various synaptic contacts found in the geniculate neuropil. Three major types of synaptic terminal have been described in the main, A-laminae of the catâs lateral geniculate nucleus Guillery, 1969a,b Sherman and Guillery, 1996 . One type, which we shall refer to as RL see Terminology and identification section in Materials and Methods , is very large, has round vesicles, and forms asymmetric contacts this derives from retina. Another, much smaller type we refer to as RS1 also has round vesicles and forms asymmetric contacts this de-rives chiefly from cortex and brainstem. The third type, F, has flattened or pleomorphic vesicles and forms sym-metric contacts this type derives almost exclusively from local g-aminobutyric acid GABA ergic cellsâboth intrageniculate interneurons and cells of the nearby thalamic reticular nucleus. This last type has been fur-ther subdivided into terminals arising from axons of these local GABAergic cells F1 and terminals emanat-ing from distal dendrites of interneurons F2 . It is of obvious importance to determine the distribution of these various synaptic terminals and their relationship to relay cells and interneurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Several electron microscopic studies have pro-vided estimates of the relative number of synaptic termi-nals in the geniculate neuropil, suggesting that the rela-tive percentages of RL, RS, and F terminals are roughly 15â20%, 50â60%, and 20â30%, respectively Guillery, 1969a Wilson et al., 1984 Eris Â¸ir et al., 1998 . However, these studies have typically included all synaptic termi-nals encountered in single thin sections without dealing with possible sampling biases. We have shown in a study of the RS terminals that the size of the synaptic contact zone strongly biases the probability of detecting the ter-minal in most sampling strategies Eris Â¸ir et al., 1997 . This is because the larger the contact zone, the more consecutive thin sections it will traverse, and thus the more likely any particular thin section will include the contact zone. Thus, by measuring the size of the synaptic zones with serial reconstruction, it is possible to correct for these biases, and we have used an algorithm here to do so. Also, by combining this with immunohistochemistry for GABA, we were able to distinguish between relay cell and interneuron targets of the various synapses and thus es-timate the relative distribution of inputs for each cell type. MATERIALS AND METHODS We studied the brains of 11 adult cats using techniques that we have described previously Wilson et al., 1984 Bick-ford et al., 1993 Eris Â¸ir et al., 1997, 1998 and that are briefly outlined below. All animals were treated strictly in accor-dance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, and the protocols used were approved by the Insti-tutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the State Uni-versity of New York at Stony Brook. Following deep barbi-turate anesthesia, the cats were perfused transcardially with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde or 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. We postfixed the brains overnight with the same fixative and then cut them in the sagittal plane on a Leica VT 1000 S vibratome at 50â60 mm. Sections through the lateral geniculate nucleus were trimmed to a selected area, osmicated in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer PB at pH 7.4, dehydrated in a graded series of ethyl alcohol, and treated with a 1 1, then a 3 1 mixture of resin Durcupan ACM Epoxy from Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA and 100% ethyl alcohol. Sections were then vacuum infiltrated in pure resin overnight, flat embedded between two pieces of ACLAR Ted Pella, Redding, CA , and placed in a 68Â°C oven for 48â72 hours. The embedded sections were blocked to in-clude the A-laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus and glued onto the end of a blank resin block. All the data presented here are taken from the A-laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus. We cut serial ultrathin sections at approximately 80 nm on a Rechert-Jung Ultracut E ultra-microtome and placed these on Formvar-coated, nickel single-slot grids. All sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to add contrast. Every fifth or sixth section was immunostained for GABA with a postembedding procedure following a previously de-scribed protocol Phend et al., 1992 Bickford et al., 1994 . Briefly, sections were incubated in anti-GABA Sigma, St. Louis, MO primary antibody diluted 1 4000â1 5000 in a Tris-buffered saline solution with Triton X-100 TBST , pH 7.6, rinsed, and followed by treatment in a gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary diluted 1 25 15nm Amer-sham Life Sciences, Arlinton Heights, IL in TBST, pH 8.2. We determined synapse and terminal sizes from serial reconstructions through these structures. We first photo-graphed synaptic zones of the three main terminal types RL, RS, and F that showed clear synaptic areas at a scope magnification of 312,000 with a JEOL 1200 EXII electron microscope. A low-power micrograph 3500 was also taken of the areas, which enabled us to use land-marks such as blood vessels, somata, etc. to help locate the same terminal in adjacent sections. To keep track of all the synaptic zones within each terminal in an orderly fashion, it was critical to examine the ultrathin sections in the same orientation. For this purpose, the goniometer of the electron microscope proved to be useful to maintain a consistent orientation throughout the serial sections. To identify RL, RS, and F terminals in the A-laminae of the lateral geniculate, we used jour major criteria when examining the vesicle-filled profiles 1 GABA content, 2 mitochondria contrast pale or dark , 3 vesicle shape round or pleomorphic , and 4 synaptic zone appearance symmetrical or asymmetrical . The main discrimination between relay cells and interneurons was based on GABA immunoreactivity, since interneurons contain GABA and relay cells do not. The mitochondria contrast was used to discriminate between RL and RS terminals, although mi-tochondria could not always be recognized in RS termi-nals. F1 terminals, which derive from axons of interneu-rons and thalamic reticular cells, are strictly presynaptic, whereas F2 terminals, which derive from peripheral den-dritic appendages of interneurons, are both pre-and postsynaptic. We could make this distinction with serial reconstructions through F terminals. Otherwise all GABAergic terminals are classified as F. For RS termi-nals, which include cortical and brainstem axons, no fur-ther classification is performed since morphological crite-ria alone are not sufficient for such classification. From examination of the serial micrographs, we deter-mined the terminal type, the number of synaptic zones each individual terminal displayed, the number of serial sections an individual synapse spanned, and its postsyn-aptic partner. When possible, depending on whether a glial sheath could be seen, we recorded whether a synaptic contact was made within or outside of a glomerulus. Three-dimensional reconstructions were made using HVEM 3-D University of Colorado and microVoxel In-dec Systems systems. Statistical analyses were performed by using non-parametric tests Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, or Kruskal-Wallis . DISCUSSION We have devised a method of controlling for biases in sampling synaptic terminals from single thin sections with the electron microscope. We did this by determining from serial sections the actual size of a synaptic zone, since the probability of encountering a synapse in a single section varies with this size. We applied this to identified synaptic terminals in the A-laminae of the catâs lateral geniculate nucleus and found that the correction for sam-pling biases produced some changes in previous estimates for the relative numbers of synaptic inputs onto geniculate cells. For instance, we found that retinal terminals were fewer than previously thought onto relay cells, but some-what more than previously thought onto interneurons. Although we have restricted our sampling to the lateral geniculate in this study, it would seem possible that this sampling strategy and correction could be used through-out the brain when there is a chance of sampling bias. Relative numbers of synapses It had been appreciated for some time that retinal RL synapses were a minority of those found in the neuropil, but previous estimates generally placed the value for these to be about 15â20% of all those present. By control-ling for sampling biases and also by using immunohisto-chemistry to determine the relay cell or interneuron tar-gets of these terminals, we now provide new estimates that significantly alter the picture of relative synaptic numbers in the lateral geniculate nucleus. We find that only about 7% of synapses on relay cells are from retina, whereas nearly half of the synapses on interneurons de-rive from retina. Thus retinal inputs to relay cells are less than half the amount previously suggested, and those on interneurons are twice previously suggested values. It would be useful to know how generally these numbers apply to other thalamic nuclei, but such data are presently unavailable. Geniculate relay cells receive most of their retinal input from one or a very small number of retinal axons, and the receptive fields of relay cells with their center surround organization are, to a first approximation, nearly identical to those of their retinal inputs reviewed in Sherman and Spear, 1982 Stone, 1983 Sherman, 1985 . Geniculate re-ceptive fields do not seem very similar to those of their cortical inputs, which do not have a center surround orga-nization and display selectivity for orientation and often for direction Tsumoto and Suda, 1980 Grieve and Sillito, 1995 . Also, whereas we know little about the response properties of brainstem inputs to the lateral geniculate nucleus, it seems a safe bet that they do not have center surround receptive fields. It thus seems from a receptive field standpoint that retinal input dominates the response properties of relay cells. This can also be seen in experi-ments in which a retinal axon and its postsynaptic genic-ulate target are simultaneously recorded Cleland et al., 1971 Cleland and Lee, 1985 Usrey et al., 1998 , because a large fraction of the action potentials in the geniculate cell are directly attributable to retinal firing. This picture of retinal input dominating geniculate re-lay cell properties may at first seem at odds with the observation that retinal synapses are such a small per-centage of inputs to these geniculate cells. We can assume that the strength or efficacy of retinal synapses is much stronger, on average, than that of other synapses on relay cells. There are two possible explanations for this. First, this may be related to the finding that the sizes of the retinal contact zones on relay cells tend to be much larger than those of other inputs Fig. 6 . Second, numerous studies have shown that synapses can vary greatly with respect to the probability that an action potential invading the presynaptic terminal will lead to transmitter release reviewed in Lisman, 1997 . If each retinal synapse, on average has a much higher probability of release than other synapses, then the effective excitatory postsynaptic potential EPSP from an action potential in a retinal axon would be relatively much larger than expected from the data of Figure 7DâF. For example, if a retinal axon pro-duced, say, 500 synapses on a relay cell, each with a probability of release of 0.9, then an action potential along that axon would lead to 450 active synapses. If several cortical axons together produced 1,000 synapses onto the same cell and fired together, but the probability of release of their synapses was only 0.1, then only 100 synapses would be activated. Thus, before we can begin to relate relative synaptic numbers, as derived in this study, to functional properties, we must know more about synaptic physiology of these inputs than we do presently. Drivers versus modulators It has been argued elsewhere Sherman and Guillery, 1998 that driver and modulator inputs may be generally recognized and distinguished throughout thalamus and perhaps in other parts of the brain and that driver inputs are generally a small minority. By the criteria suggested Sherman and Guillery, 1998 retinal afferents to the lat-eral geniculate nucleus can be recognized as the driver input, whereas all the other inputs, from cortex, brain-stem, and local GABAergic cells, represent the modulator inputs. In this context of drivers and modulators, we can offer a reasonable but speculative explanation for the ob-served differences in numbers. To carry basic information to the thalamic target, which is the main purpose of a driver, requires a relatively small number of inputs. That is not to say that a small number of inputs means a weak postsynaptic effect, because as noted above, driver inputs may have relatively effective synapses. On the other hand, neuromodulation is usually finely graded and may be linked in complicated ways to the many different qualities of behavioral state, such as alertness and attention. Thus to carry out neuromodulatory functions may require a much larger number of inputs. We can also make an analogy to what is seen in many parts of the brain for which the main result of complex neural computations is carried by relatively few cells. In cortex, for instance, the number of cells carrying the output message for a column e.g., some layer 5 cells projecting to subcortical targets represents a minority of cells in the column. It is also interesting to compare, in cats, the retinogenicu-late inputs with geniculocortical inputs to layer 4 of striate cortex. Both inputs can be recognized as drivers, because both determine the basic receptive field properties of their postsynaptic cells Cleland and Lee, 1985 Ferster, 1987, 1994 Reid and Alonso, 1996 Usrey et al., 1998 . It has been estimated that geniculocortical axons contribute only about 5â6% of the total synapses to their target cells in layer 4 Peters and Payne, 1993 Ahmed et al., 1994 . This value is remarkably close to the 7% we have determined for retinal input to geniculate relay cells. Perhaps this close quantita-tive similarity for two different driver pathways is a coinci-dence, but we can only determine how commonly driver inputs are limited to 5â10% of synapses at their target by quantitatively studying more identified driver pathways. RESULTS The morphological criteria for differentiating terminal types in the lateral geniculate nucleus were sufficient to identify reliably GABA-containing F terminals derived from local GABAergic cells , RL terminals derived from retina , and RS terminals derived almost exclusively ei-ther from cortex or from the parabrachial region of brain-stem . Figure 1 illustrates typical examples. Figure 1A shows an RL terminal that is large and GABA negative and an F terminal that is small and GABA positive. Fig-ure 1B shows another F terminal that is small and GABA positive along with an RS terminal that is small and GABA negative. The postsynaptic targets, usually den-drites, of identified terminals were also classified as be-longing to relay cells, by being GABA negative Fig. 1 , or interneurons, by being GABA positive Fig. 1A . Overall, we examined 208 synaptic zones from RL terminals, 159 from RS, and 120 from F. We also serially reconstructed 14 RL, 15 RS, and 41 F 28 F1 type and 13 F2 type terminals plus their synaptic zones. An example of these serial reconstructions is given in Figure 2. Figure 2A shows one of the thin sections of the series, with the F2 and RL terminals that were recon-structed, and Figure 2B,C shows the results of the recon-struction. It is worth noting that every one of these seri-ally reconstructed terminals had at least one discernable synaptic contact zone of course, such zones were fre-quently missed in many single sections. Terminal sizes From the serial reconstructions of complete terminals, we could determine the sizes of the different terminal types. Figure 3 summarizes these results in terms of the number of serial sections traversed by each terminal. As expected, RL terminals were the largest spanning 55.6 6 5.4 sections here and below, the 6 values refer to the standard error of mean , F terminals next in average size spanning 26.8 6 1.4 sections , and RS terminals the smallest spanning 15.9 6 0.9 sections . These differences between any pairs of terminal were significant P # 0.001 . Within F terminals, we found no significant differ-ence between the sizes of the F1 and F2 subtypes for F1, 25.8 6 1.5 sections for F2, 28.9 6 3.2 sections P . 0.1 . Figure 4 shows for each serially reconstructed terminal the relationship between its actual volume and number of contacts formed. Note that the axes are scaled logarithmi-cally. For the volume calculations, we measured the cross-sectional area of each terminal in each section and as-sumed a section thickness of 80 nm. The volumes of these terminals are as follows for RL terminals, 9.58 6 1.29 mm3 for RS terminals, 0.39 6 0.05 mm3 for F1 terminals, 1.47 6 0.21 mm3 and for F2 terminals, 1.99 6 0.33 mm3. Except for the comparison between F1 and F2 terminals, which shows no statistically significant difference in size P . 0.1 , each pairwise comparison of these terminal types reveals a statistically significant difference P , 0.001 for each comparison . It is interesting that RL and RS terminals show no overlap in volume. This suggests that the larger RS terminals, which have been called âRLDâ for âroundâ vesicle, âlargeâ profile, and âdarkâ mi-tochondria Montero, 1991 , either are small with respect to RL terminals or they are rare enough to be absent from our sample see also Eris Â¸ir et al., 1997 . Synaptic contact zones Number of contact zones. Also from the serial recon-structions of complete terminals, we could determine the number of synaptic contacts formed by the terminals Fig. 4 . Typically, RS terminals contained a single synaptic zone. In contrast, RL and F terminals formed multiple contacts with several profiles. Examples of the synaptic relationships of three geniculate terminals in three-dimensional reconstructions are illustrated in Figure 2. RL terminals contained the most synaptic contact zones 9.1 6 1.6 , F terminals contained the next in number 2.6 6 0.2 , and RS terminals contained the fewest 1.02 6 0.02 . With one exception, these differences were statisti-cally significant for each pairwise comparison P # 0.001 , including comparisons involving the F1 and F2 subsets of F terminals. The exception was the comparison between F1 and F2 terminals synapses formed by F1 terminals 2.8 6 0.3 were not significantly different in number from those formed by F2 terminals 2.2 6 0.3 P . 0.1 . It should be noted that, for F2 terminals, although we also found postsynaptic specializations on the terminals, the above counts refer only to synapses formed by F2 termi-nals onto other profiles, which were always GABA nega-tive i.e., relay cell dendrites. Figure 4 also shows a general and significant, positive relationship between the size of a terminal and number of contacts it forms. This is seen for the entire population of terminals r 5 10.86, n 5 70, P , 0.001 as well as for the subsets of RL terminals r 5 0.70, n 5 14, P , 0.01 , F1 terminals r 5 10.76, n 5 28, P , 0.001 , and F2 terminals r 5 10.82, n 5 13, P , 0.001 . Only RS terminals showed no correlation r 5 10.19, n 5 15, P . 0.1 , possibly because, with one exception, these terminals formed only a single synapse. Sizes of contact zones. The size of the contact zone for each terminal type was determined from the serial reconstructions through these zones as the number of consecutive sections that a morphologically identified syn-aptic zone traversed. We serially reconstructed many more synaptic zones than terminals, because the samples were selected mainly based on clear synapses rather than terminal bouton morphology, and only a subset of termi-nal boutons were photographed and reconstructed in their entirety. Basically, we started with a grid that was near the middle of a series, located in an area of lamina A and or A1, and sampled every synapse we could clearly detect. We then photographed adjacent ultrathin sections preceding and following this middle section to allow serial reconstruction. Any new synapse or terminal encountered in this stack of photographs was included in the sampled until we reached the end of the series. As noted below, this initial sampling procedure provided a sufficient number of synapses for reliable statistical analysis for all types studied with one exception we initially sample only seven examples of synapses from RS terminals onto interneurons, and thus to increase the number of these syn-apses we went through our material a second time and selected only RS synapses onto interneurons until we reached a predetermined number i.e., equal to the number of RS synapses we sampled onto relay cells see also below . We do not contend that our original sample was unbiased, and in fact we argue that larger synapses are more likely to be sampled. From the serial reconstructions we could deter-mine synaptic sizes and correct for this sampling error. The major assumption we must make is that each of the synaptic types we analyze RL, RS, F1, and F2 have a synaptic size distribution in our randomly chosen regions of the A-laminae that is representative of the sizes elsewhere in the A-laminae. Nowhere must we assume that the numbers of synapses we sampled are representative or even random. This is the whole point of correcting for sizeâwe only need assume that the sizes, and not numbers, of the original sample are representative. The choice of the number of synaptic zones rather than the real measure e.g., nm as the unit of synapse size was arbitrary, although the real size of a synaptic zone can po-tentially be estimated by taking into account such factors as the average thickness of each section i.e., roughly 80 nm and shrinkage due to fixation unmeasured . Figure 5 sum-marizes the sizes of each synaptic type. Overall, RL termi-nals formed the largest synaptic zones traversing 8.8 6 0.5 sections, n 5 208 , F terminals were next traversing 6.1 6 0.4 sections, n 5 120 , and contacts from RS terminals were smallest traversing 5.0 6 0.2 sections, n 5 159 . Statisti-cally, RL synapses were larger than F P , 0.01 or RS P , 0.001 synapses, but F and RS synapses were not signifi-cantly different P . 0.1 . However, other differences became manifest whenever it was possible to divide the F terminals into F1 and F2. Synapses from the former 7.0 6 0.4 sections were larger than those from the latter 4.1 6 0.4 sections P , 0.001 . Compared with RL synapses, those from F1 terminals were similar in size P . 0.1 , but those from F2 terminals were smaller P , 0.001 compared WITH RS synapses, those from F1 terminals were larger P , 0.001 , but those from F2 terminals were smaller P , 0.001 . In a subset of our sampled terminals, it was possible to identify the postsynaptic sites as from relay cells or inter-neurons. There were further differences in synaptic zone size depending on the target or location of each terminal type. For relay cells Fig. 5B , RL synapses extend over 12.1 6 0.8 n 5 111 sections, which is larger than those from F terminals 5.7 6 0.4 sections, n 5 42 , including the F1 and F2 subtypes 7.1 6 0.6 and 4.1 6 0.4 sections, respectively , and from RS terminals 5.7 6 0.4 sections, n 5 31 . These differences are statistically significant P , 0.001 for each pairwise comparison for RL terminals . The fact that RL terminals span more sections, on average, than any other type implies that most sampling strategies result in their over-representation. The size differences between F1 and F2 synapses on relay cells and also be- tween F2 and RS synapses are also significant P , 0.001 for each comparison . However, there is no size difference between RS and F or F1 synapses on relay cells P . 0.1 . On interneurons, the comparison of synaptic sizes shows some surprising differences from those on relay cells Fig. 5C . Here, RL synapses are the smallest 4.7 6 0.3 sections, n 5 85 . F terminals are intermediate in size 6.7 6 0.7 sections, n 5 32 since no F2 terminals were found in contact with interneurons in our data, these F terminals contacting interneurons are all F1 and RS terminals are the largest 7.2 6 0.4 sections, n 5 31 . These differences are all statistically significant P , 0.01 for each pairwise comparison for RL terminals . Thus, unlike the situation for relay cells, RL terminals would be under-represented in most sampling strategies.2 As implied from the above, some of these terminal types differ in the sizes of the synapses they form on relay cells versus interneurons. The differences for RL and RS ter-minals are statistically significant P , 0.001 and P , 0.01, respectively . However, no significant difference was found for F terminals P . 0.05 or their F1 subtype P . 0.1 . Also, RL terminals formed larger synapses onto relay cells outside than inside of the glomerular zones 10.2 6 0.7 sections inside versus 21.5 6 2.9 sections outside P , 0.001 not illustrated . The situation for RL terminals is different for interneurons 4.47 6 0.2 sections inside glo-meruli and 6.7 6 1.5 sections outside , but this difference is not significant P . 0.1 . Correction for sampling biases Number of synapses. We previously reported the rel-ative distribution of synapses from the various terminal types in the geniculate laminae using data collected from single sections Eris Â¸ir et al., 1998 . That study, based on 1159 synapses from six brains, found that 17.9% of all syn-apses are formed by RL terminals, 29.3% by F, and 52.9% by RS Fig. 6A . Because these data were obtained in the tra-ditional manner from single sections, from which it is usu-ally impossible to distinguish between F1 and F2 terminals i.e., serial reconstruction is required for this distinction , only F terminals as a whole are considered here. Further analysis of these data revealed the specific distribution pat-tern of terminals onto relay cells n 5 994 and interneurons n 5 165 separately for relay cells, 14.6% of the synapses derive from RL terminals, 29.6% from F, and 55.8% from RS Fig. 6B for interneurons, the values are 37.8% from RL terminals, 26.8% from F, and 35.4% from RS Fig. 6C . However, as noted in the Introduction, these data and others like them were not corrected for sampling biases based on the greater likelihood of sampling terminals with larger synaptic zones in single thin sections. Our goal here was to provide a correction for a possible bias in many published accounts of terminal distribution that favors sampling terminals with larger synaptic contact zones see Eris Â¸ir et al., 1997, for a fuller discussion of this . That is, prior investigators including us would select all ter-minals forming a clear synaptic contact in a proscribed region of a single thin section. Here, we make the assump-tion that the chance of detecting a terminal with this strategy is linearly proportional to the size of its contact zone i.e., the larger the contact, the more thin sections it traverses, and the more likely that any single section will capture the contact . We could then estimate the relative probability of sampling each terminal type based on the synaptic zone size, which we have determined in Figure 5. Because we sectioned the material studied here in the same sagittal plane and sampled from similar regions of the lateral geniculate nucleus, any sampling artifacts based on different anisometries in the shape of synaptic zones from different terminals could be ignored. We could thus reduce the relative probability of encountering one of these terminals to the number of sections in a series that contained the synaptic zone. We can now use this to de-termine the appropriate correction and apply this to the counts of Figure 6 to obtain a more accurate measure of the relative numbers of the various synaptic types in the neuropil of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Details of the method we used to correct for sampling biases can be found in Eris Â¸ir et al. 1997 . Briefly, we as-sumed that the bias of sampling each synaptic type is pro-portional to its size, or more precisely, to the average number of consecutive sections it spans. We thus adjusted the rela-tive number of each synaptic type accordingly by using two sets of data to estimate the corrected percentages of the various synaptic types, which we denoted RLs, Fs or F1s and F2s , and RSs. One set was the raw uncorrected per-centages of RL, F, and RS synapses RLr, Fr, and RSr , and the other was the correction factors number of sections per synapse for sampling biases of RL, F, and RS synapses cRLs, cFs, and cRSs . The formulae we adopted were 100* RLr* cFs* cRSs RLr* cFs* cRSs1cRLs* Fr* cRSs1cRLs* cFs* RSr 100* Fr* cRSs* cRLs RLr* cFs* cRSs1cRLs* Fr* cRSs1cRLs* cFs* RSr 100* RSr* cFs* cRLs RLr* cFs* cRSs1cRLs* Fr* cRSs1cRLs* cFs* RSr When we applied these corrections to the data of Figure 6AâC, we obtained the following quantitative distribution of geniculate synapses that should now be less affected by sampling biases. Out of all synapses, 11.7% were formed by RL terminals, 27.5% by F, and 60.8% by RS Fig. 6D . The corrected distribution of synapses onto relay cells revealed that 7.1% came from RL terminals, 30.9% from F terminals, and 62.0% from RS Fig. 6E .3 Onto interneu-rons, the values are 47.4% from RL terminals, 23.6% from F, and 29.0% from RS Fig. 6F . For all three sets of data i.e., all synapses, those onto relay cells, and those onto interneurons , the difference between the uncorrected and corrected values are statistically significant P , 0.001 . Also, in the corrected distributions, the difference in syn-aptic distributions onto relay cells versus interneurons is statistically significant P , 0.001 . Thus, in relative terms, there are many fewer RL synapses and many more RS synapses and somewhat more F synapses on relay cells than on interneurons. Number of terminals. The above calculations are based on synapse counts, since the sampling starts with an identifiable synapse. However, since synaptic terminals can produce multiple synapses, the relative distribution of actual terminals in the neuropil of the A-laminae cannot be deter-mined just from the corrected estimates of synapse numbers in Figure 6D. For instance, since RL terminals produce many more synapses, on average, than F or RS terminals, the actual relative percentage of retinal terminals in the neuropil is much less than the 11.7% value computed for the relative number of RL synapses. We can use the data of Figure 6D together with those shown in Figure 4 to compute estimates for the terminal distributions. The approach is similar to that described in Eqs. [1]â[3] 100* RLs* cFt* cRSt RLs* cFt* cRSt1cRLt* Fs* cRSt1cRLt* cFt* RSs 100* Fs* cRLt* cRSt RLs* cFt* cRSt1cRLt* Fs* cRSt1cRLt* cFt* RSs 100* RSs* cRLt* cFt RLs* cFt* cRSt1cRLt* Fs* cRSt1cRLt* cFt* RSs where RLt, Ft, and RSt are the estimated percentages of RL, F, and RS terminals RLs, Fs, and RSs are the cor-rected percentages of RL, F, and RS synapses from Eqs. [1]â[3] and cRLt, cFt, and cRSt are the correction factors number of synaptic zones per terminals for RL, F, and RS terminals. Figure 7 shows the results of these calculations. We now estimate that RL terminals represent only 1.8% of all terminals in the A-laminae, F terminals represent 14.5%, and RS terminals represent 83.7%. The rarity of RL ter-minals has perhaps been unappreciated because of their very large size, which enhances the probability that they will be seen in a given thin section. CONCLUSIONS We have determined with methods that control for prob-lematic sampling biases that retinal inputs to relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat produce only 7% of the synapses on these cells, although they produce nearly half the inputs to interneurons. However, for relay cells that must transport retinal messages to cortex, most inputs de-rive from cortex, brainstem, and local GABAergic cells. One important conclusion we draw from this is that it can often be greatly misleading to attribute relative functional impor-tance to relative numbers of synapses. For instance, if we had only the sort of anatomical information about the lateral geniculate nucleus provided in the current study, we might be tempted to conclude that this nucleus was little influ-enced by retina and instead mainly relayed brainstem infor-mation to cortex. This caution may apply outside of thala-mus as well. Thus, until one knows the functional significance of a pathway, particularly with regard to its driver or modulator status, one would be unwise to attribute much functional significance to that pathway.

J. Comp. Neurol. 416 101â111, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The red nucleus and rubrospinal tract comprise a major descending motor system found in nearly all vertebrates that functions in coordination with the cerebellum and cerebral cortex in the control of movement. Neurons in the magnocellular red nucleus of the awake, behaving monkey or cat discharge in high-frequency bursts that are associ-ated with discrete limb movements Ghez and Kubota, 1977 Gibson et al., 1985a,b Cheney et al., 1988 Van Kan et al., 1994 Miller and Houk, 1995 Miller and Sinkjaer, 1998 . The rubrospinal system phylogenetically precedes the emergence of the motor cortex and corticospinal tract. It has been suggested that the development of the rubrospi-nal tract in vertebrates is related to the presence of limbs or related structures Ten Donkelaar, 1988 . Tract tracing studies have established the basic connectivity of the red nucleus in some vertebrates for review, see Keifer and Houk, 1994 . The cerebellum provides a predominant input to the red nucleus, and there are projections from ascending sensory systems such as the dorsal column nuclei. The mammalian red nucleus also receives direct projections from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex. This cortical pathway is particularly well-developed in mammals as compared to non-mammalian vertebrates.An exception, however, is found in birds, where a ââcorticoââ-rubral projection from the hyperstriatum accessorium of the anterior Wulst to the red nucleus is present Wild, 1992 . Recently, a direct descending projection from the hypothalamus to the red nucleus of turtles was described by using retrograde and anterograde tract tracing Her-rick and Keifer, 1997 . In rats, [3H]choline injections into the red nucleus consistently labeled the lateral hypotha-lamic and medial preoptic areas Bernays et al., 1988 , thereby supporting the presence of a descending hypothal-amorubral pathway, at least in some vertebrates. The relative organization of synaptic inputs from the cerebel-lum, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex onto individual rubrospinal neurons will have a strong influence on shap-ing the motor signals that originate in the red nucleus. The microcircuitry of synaptic inputs to the red nucleus has been studied to some extent. Corticorubral fibers have been found to synapse on distal portions of rubrospinal dendrites. Using wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase WGA-HRP combined with elec-tron microscopy, Ralston 1994a concluded that the major-ity of labeled corticorubral afferents terminate on the distal dendrites of rubrospinal neurons in monkeys. Simi-lar results have been found for cat Wilson et al., 1987 and opossum King et al., 1972 . In contrast to the cortical inputs, cerebellar afferents make synaptic contact on the proximal dendrites and the soma of monkey, cat, and rat rubrospinal neurons monkey Ralston, 1994b cat Naka-mura and Mizuno, 1971 Wilson et al., 1987 rat Aumann and Horne, 1996 . The degree of segregation of cortical and cerebellar synapses on red nucleus neurons, however, is questionable because cerebellar inputs have been ob-served distally and cortical inputs proximally Ralston, 1994b Aumann and Horne, 1996 . The aim of the present study was to examine the microcircuitry of the red nucleus in relation to its cerebel-lar and descending control. This study used two species the Sprague-Dawley rat and the freshwater pond turtle Chrysemys picta. Although both species have a well-developed cerebellorubrospinal system, they differ in that rats receive direct cortical input to the red nucleus, whereas turtles do not. Thus, comparison of the two species, only one of which has evolved directly descending cortical motor control, may show relative functional contri-butions of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex to motor signal generation in the red nucleus. This study examined anterogradely labeled boutons apposed to Lucifer Yellow LY âfilled rubrospinal neurons in both species. The re-sults show that the cellular distribution of cerebellar inputs on rubrospinal neurons is similar between rats and turtles these projections are observed on the soma and the proximal and distal dendrites. In contrast, the hypotha-lamic inputs in turtles occupy mainly more distally located dendrites, similar to the position of the cortical inputs in rats. These findings suggest that, first, the cerebellar inputs are not spatially segregated from the cortical or hypothalamic inputs in rats or turtles, as observed by light microscopy. Second, input from the cortex in rats and hypothalamus in turtles is specific to the distal portions of the dendrites. The similarity in the organizational fea-tures of the mammalian and non-mammalian cerebelloru-brospinal systems has implications for interpretations of the parallel or divergent functions of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex in adaptive motor control. Intracellular injection of LY A fluorescent microscope equipped with a long working distance objective and a hydraulic micromanipulator was used for the injections. A 10% solution of LY was prepared in distilled water. Lucifer Yellow was introduced into a rubrospinal neuron with iontophoresis by applying a nega-tive DC current of 10 nA over a period of 2â10 minutes, as described by Lustig et al. 1998 .After there was no further filling of dendrites, the current was reversed to prevent leakage of LY during pipette withdrawal. After filling several neurons within the thick section, the tissue was postfixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde to stabilize the LY in the dendrites and soma. After postfixation of at least 24 hours, sections were mounted on slides and coverslipped by rinsing twice in PB pH 7.4 and dehydrated through graded dilutions of alcohol, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped using mounting medium. Imaging and data analysis Photomicrographs of LY-filled rubrospinal neurons and anterogradely labeled terminal boutons were taken by using epifluorescence on a Leitz Aristoplan microscope. Double exposures were taken of the material with the appropriate excitation filters. Images were imported into a PowerMac computer using a film scanner, where the images were adjusted for brightness and contrast byAdobe Photoshop software Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA and printed on a 8650 PS Kodak Color Printer. Digital images were analyzed on the computer by using the NIH Image program http rsb.info.nih.gov nih-image . The following parameters were measured by using this soft-ware the distance along the dendrite a labeled bouton was observed to be from the soma measured from the point that the dendrite emerged from the soma rather than from soma center , the diameter of the dendrite to which the bouton was apposed, and the diameter of the bouton. For most of the filled neurons in our data set, the soma, primary, secondary, and tertiary dendrites were visible in a single image. Thus, the distance of the boutons from the soma and their location on dendritic branches could be determined. However, the distance of the bouton from the soma could not be measured for the entire data set because only portions of some neurons were captured in the images. For the purposes of classification of boutons, a ââdistalââ dendrite is defined as one that is farther than 40 Î¼m from the soma Table 1 . This criterion will be dis-cussed in the Results. Whether the bouton was apposed to the soma, primary, secondary, or tertiary dendrite was also recorded. In addition, measurements of the major and minor axes of LY-filled somata from the turtle were made to determine that they were within the range of rubrospi-nal neurons. Statistical analysis was performed with StatView software Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA , and significant differences were estimated by using analysis of variance and paired t-tests. Data are presented as means 6 S.E., except where noted. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surgical procedures and application of fluorescent tracers Rubrospinal neurons of the rat were retrogradely la-beled by spinal cord injections of Fast Blue FB to visualize them for the intracellular LY fills Lustig et al., 1998 . Sprague-Dawley rats n 5 17 were anesthetized with chloral hydrate 35 mg kg adminstered intraperitone-ally. The cervical spinal cord was approached with a small midline incision, and a laminectomy was performed at the levels of C5âT1. The dura was incised, and 4% FB was pressure injected by using a micropipette of approximately 80 Î¼m tip diameter mounted on a stereotaxic frame. The amount of injectate delivered was monitored by visual inspection of the meniscus in the pipette with a surgical microscope. Injections were placed bilaterally into the spinal cord to label axons passing in the rubrospinal tract. Between 0.4 and 0.6 Î¼l FB was injected in small amounts over a 10 minute period. After injection of FB, the dura, muscles, and skin were sutured by using standard surgical procedures. Anterograde labeling of cortical, cerebellar, and hypotha-lamic projections in the rat was accomplished in different experiments by using a micropipette filled with 10% Fluoro-Ruby FR . All injections of FR were made with the aid of a stereotaxic frame. After a small opening was drilled into the cranium on both sides, multiple injections of a total volume of 0.6 Î¼l FR were made bilaterally into the motor cortex, approximately 2.0â3.0 mm rostral to Bregma, 1.0â2.0 mm lateral to the midline, and at a depth of 1.0 mm Paxinos and Watson, 1982 . Cerebellar injections were performed in a similar manner. A cranial opening was made, and bilateral injections of 0.4 Î¼l FR were made targeting the interpositus nucleus using stereotaxic coordi-nates of 2.3 mm caudal to the interaural suture, 1.3â2.8 mm lateral to the midline, and 5.5â5.7 mm in depth. For bilateral injections of the lateral hypothalamus, injections of 0.4 Î¼l were made at 2.0â4.0 mm caudal to Bregma, 2.0 mm lateral to the midline, and at a depth of 8.0â9.0 mm. The incisions were sutured closed, and Sensorcaine 0.25% Astra Pharmaceutical, Westborough, MA was applied to relieve postsurgical discomfort. Animals survived for 5 days and then were given a lethal dose of sodium pentobar-bitol and perfused with cold saline ,200â300 ml followed by 500 ml of cold 3% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed, and the mescencephalon containing the red nucleus was sectioned on a Vibratome EMS, Fort Washing-ton, PA at 150 Î¼m. Freshwater pond turtles n 5 16, Chyrsemys picta were anesthetized by hypothermia Marcus, 1981 Parsons and Huggins, 1965 and decapitated. The brain was quickly dissected out and placed in a bath, where it was super-fused in physiological saline 2â4 ml minute containing in mM NaCl 100, NaHCO3 40, KCl 6, CaCl2 2.6, MgCl2 1.6, and glucose 20, which was oxygenated with 95% O2 5% CO2 and maintained at room temperature 22â24Â°C at pH 7.6 Keifer, 1996 . Pressure injections with a total volume of 0.2 Î¼l FR mixed in 1 N HCl were made bilaterally into either the cerebellar peduncle, which contains the deep cerebellar nuclei, or the suprapeduncular nucleus of the hypothalamus to label axons and terminals by antereo-grade transport that project to the red nucleus Sarrafiza-deh et al., 1993 Herrick and Keifer, 1997 . After a trans-port period of 16â24 hours, the brain was immersion fixed in cold 3% paraformaldehyde for about 20 hours. Brains were sectioned at 150 Î¼m through the mescencephalon with a Vibratome and placed in 0.1 M phospate buffer PB at pH 7.4. Because of the lack of an adequate retrograde tracer that can be used in vitro, rubrospinal neurons in the turtle could not be identified by retrograde tract tracing. Instead, LY-filled red nucleus neurons in the turtle were identified as being rubrospinal neurons based on measure-ments of their soma size, as described previously Keifer et al., 1992 Lustig et al., 1998 . In some experiments, the nuclear stain 48,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR was used to facilitate the visualiza-tion of turtle neurons during filling with LY.All experimen-tal protocols on the use of animals complied with the guidelines of the NIH and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. DISCUSSION Parvicellular versus magnocellular divisions of red nucleus in rat The red nucleus is divided into two main components, a caudally located magnocellular division and a rostrally located parvicellular division. The two divisions are de-fined by their connectivity. The magnocellular red nucleus gives rise to the rubrospinal tract, whereas the parvicellu-lar division projects to the inferior olive. The first appear-ance of the parvicellular red nucleus is in quadrupedal reptiles, and it is expanded in mammals until it is most developed in apes and humans. Studies in rats have suggested that the cortical projections to the red nucleus terminate in the parvicellular division alone Brown, 1974 Gwyn and Flumerfelt, 1974 . In monkeys, in which the parvicellular division is well-developed, the magnocellular red nucleus also receives input from the cortex Hartman von Monakow et al., 1979 . The present findings clearly fail to support the interpretation that only the parvicellu-lar red nucleus receives cortical innervation in rats be-cause terminals originating from the cortex have been observed to be apposed to retrogradely labeled rubrospinal neurons, which are by definition in the magnocellular division. Anatomical evidence in rats suggests that some rubrospinal tract projection neurons send collaterals to the inferior olive Kennedy, 1990 . Therefore, magnocellular and parvicellular rubral neurons in the rat may be overlap- ping populations. Moreover, in monkeys, the parvicellular division receives input from the cerebellar dentate nucleus, whereas the dentate projects to the entire red nucleus in the rat and overlaps with the fibers from interpositus Caughell and Flumerfelt, 1977 Angaut and Cicirata, 1988 . Thus, there appears to be no clear distinction between the magno-and parvicellular divisions of the red nucleus in the rat. Segregation of rubral inputs Previous studies using several species have suggested that there is segregation of synaptic inputs onto rubrospi-nal neurons such that cortical inputs are confined to the distal dendrites and cerebellar inputs are located on the proximal dendrites and soma Nakamura and Mizuno, 1971 King et al., 1972 Wilson et al., 1987 Ralston, 1994a,b Aumann and Horne, 1996 . Such findings have implications for the cortical or cerebellar synaptic control of motor signals that arise in the red nucleus. For example, cerebellar projections to soma and proximal dendrites are consistent with the strong synaptic responses recorded intracellularly in rubrospinal neurons from cerebellar stimulation Toyama et al., 1970 , and the observation that neuronal activity in the interpositus is similar to that in the red nucleus Van Kan et al., 1993 . The effect of distally located cortical synapses in rubrospinal signal processing is less clear, but it has been postulated to regulate the subthreshold excitability levels of rubrospinal neurons Humphrey and Reitz, 1976 . Exceptions to this general scheme of synaptic organization in the red nucleus have been observed Ralston, 1994b Aumann and Horne, 1996 . By using intracellular fills combined with anterograde tract tracing rather than electron microscopy as in those previous studies, our study examined the organization of afferent projections to the red nucleus. The aim was to compare the microcircuitry of the red nucleus in a species that has a well-developed motor cortex, as in the Sprague-Dawely rat, and one that does not, as in the freshwater pond turtle Chrysemys picta, to elucidate the relative contributions of the motor cortex and cerebellum in motor signal generation in the red nucleus. The main findings of the present study on the rat and turtle are summarized in Figure 7. Boutons labeled by injections of the cerebellum in the rat are observed to be apposed to the soma and proximal and distal dendrites of rubrospinal neurons Fig. 4, Table 1 . These results are similar to those reported by Aumann and Horne 1996 who found cerebellar synapses apposed to both proximal and distal dendrites in the rat red nucleus. That study, however, failed to observe inputs to somata. Cerebellar inputs to the soma and proximal dendrites of cats Naka-mura and Mizuno, 1971 Wilson et al., 1987 and monkeys Ralston, 1994b have been described, but those studies did not report projections to distal dendrites. In contrast, the rat corticorubral projections reported in the present study are located mainly on the distal dendrites, similar to findings in the monkey, cat, and opposum King et al., 1972 Wilson et al., 1987 Ralston, 1994a . Thus, given the cellular distribution of our sample of boutons in the rat, it appears that the more distally located dendritic arbors of rubrospinal neurons receive overlapping inputs from the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, whereas the soma and the most proximally located dendrites receive the cerebellar inputs. This partly overlapping organization of cerebellar and cortical inputs may be similar to that described in monkeys Jenny et al., 1991 Ralston, 1994a,b and should be reexamined in other mammals. The cellular localization of the hypothalamorubral projections has not been de-scribed previously in any species. In the present study, boutons from the hypothalamus in the rat were observed to be apposed to the soma and proximal and distal dendrites, and they have a spatial distribution overlap-ping with those from the cerebellum Fig. 4 see Fig. 7 . The organization of afferent inputs to the red nucleus of a non-mammalian vertebrate had not been examined until the present study. The sample of anterogradely labeled boutons from injections of the cerebellum that were ap-posed to LY-filled rubrospinal neurons in the turtle show that, as in the rat, they are distributed onto the soma and proximal and distal dendrites Fig. 4, Table 1 . Thus, the morphologic localization of cerebellar inputs onto rubrospi-nal neurons is similar between rats and turtles Fig. 7 but may not be a general feature shared by other vertebrates given that cerebellar inputs were not observed on distal dendrites of cats and monkeys. In contrast, the boutons labeled by injections into the hypothalamus mainly tar-geted the more distally located dendrites in the turtle. Only one bouton was observed to be apposed to a soma, and the remaining boutons were apposed to dendrites at least 45 Î¼m from the soma. The spatial distribution of the turtle hypothalamic inputs on rubrospinal neurons was quite similar to the distribution of boutons from the rat cortex Figs. 4, 7 . Measurements of the mean distance of boutons along the dendrites Fig. 5 and of the diameter of den- drites to which the boutons were apposed Fig. 6A suggest that inputs from the rat cortex and turtle hypothalamus are more similar to one another than to any of the other inputs that were analyzed. There are several aspects of these findings that require further consideration. First, this study was performed at the light microscopic level. This has advantages in terms of analyzing the distance of boutons along dendritic branches because the soma and dendritic arbors of intracellularly filled neurons are visible in the section of tissue. From these data, we have made interpretations on the degree of colocalization of inputs from different brain regions onto rubrospinal neurons. However, terminal fields that appear to overlap when using light microscopy may actually be, at the ultrastructural level, spatially segregated. For ex-ample, although cerebellar and cortical inputs in the rat occupy similar regions of the dendrites, they may not be physically colocalized to the same synapses. A second consideration is that it remains to be determined what percentage of our anterogradely labeled boutons are actu-ally synaptic terminals. This will require analysis at the ultrastructural level using photoconversion and electron microscopy. Third, previous studies using electron micros-copy have determined synapses to be proximally or distally located based on the diameter of the apposing dendrite. Wilson et al. 1987 found that the dendrites of intracellu-larly filled cat rubrospinal neurons tapered gradually from proximal to distal, although there is not as yet any quantitative data from any species on this point. Further, they observed that the distal dendrites were covered with spines. The presence and location of spines on rubrospinal neurons are quite variable among species for discussion, see Lustig et al., 1998 . Thus, without quantitative data on dendritic diameters as they extend outward, it may be difficult to assess which dendrites are proximal from those that are distal based on diameter alone. The techniques in this study allowed direct determination of the proximal or distal location of boutons on dendrites, although the distinction of what is ââproximalââ and ââdistalââ remains somewhat arbitrary. However, we did observe that distally located boutons from the rat cortex and turtle hypothala-mus were apposed to significantly smaller diameter den-drites than were the other types of boutons Fig. 6A , perhaps confirming that distal dendrites are consistently smaller than those more proximally located. The predominant input to the red nucleus is from the cerebellum, and data from the present study suggest that these projections encompass the soma and entire dendritic arbor of rubrospinal neurons in both rats and turtles. It was previously observed in several species of mammal that inputs from the cerebral cortex targeted the distal den-drites of rubrospinal neurons, and similar findings were observed here in rats. Until recently, it was commonly accepted that the non-mammalian red nucleus did not receive inputs from descending sources because those species lacked a motor cortex. An exception to this was described in birds Wild, 1992 , and more recently a descending pathway from the hypothalamus to the red nucleus was shown in turtles Herrick and Keifer, 1997 . An intriguing result of the present study is that the hypothalamorubral projections in turtles target the distal dendrites, much like the cortical inputs of mammals. Tract tracing studies have suggested that there may be descend-ing projections from the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia to the hypothalamus in reptiles although whether the suprapeduncular nucleus in Chrysemys picta is part of the hypothalamus or thalamus is questionable Russchen and Jonker, 1988 DÄ± Â´az et al., 1994 . In the lizard Gekko, the suprapeduncular nucleus receives a projection from the globus pallidus Russchen and Jonker, 1988 , and cortical connections via the striatum to the pallidum are present in reptiles and first appear in amphibians MarÄ± Â´n et al., 1997 . Although the pathways need to be described in turtles, evidence suggests that the dorsal and medial aspects of the reptilian cerebral cortex terminate in the hypothalamus Lohmen and Mentink, 1972 Lohmen and Van Woerden-Verkley, 1976 , thereby allowing for the possibility of indirect cortical control of the rubral motor system. These cortical areas appear to be involved in visual and somatosensory information processing, respec-tively Ulinski, 1990 . If this is the case, then interpreta-tions of the relative roles of the cerebellorubral system and the cerebral cortex in motor control may need to be revised if data suggest that the two systems are present in vertebrates. The classic view of the vertebrate motor system is that it is organized hierarchically, the lowest level being the spinal cord, next the brainstem, and at the highest level the cortical motor areas Ghez, 1991 . In this scheme, the phylogenetically older cerebellorubral and rubrospinal systems are thought to provide adaptive control of basic patterns of muscle activation such as reflexes and stereo-typic movements such as locomotion. The evolution of the motor cortex and corticospinal system in mammals is considered to reflect the much finer control of voluntary limb movements, especially of the hand and digits. It is the direct corticospinal projections that are thought to provide the main excitatory inputs for limb movements in mam-mals. This hierarchical view of the motor system can be challenged on the basis of several findings. First, evidence is accumulating that motor signals are not conveyed sequentially from independent brain regions but are gener-ated by a parallel distributed process that arises from cerebrocerebellorubral circuits Kalaska and Crammond, 1992 Houk et al., 1993 Keifer and Houk, 1994 . Unit recordings from behaving animals have shown that many areas of the motor system are simultaneously active before and during movement. Thus, it is more parsimonious to think of descending motor commands as representing a combined signal from distributed regions of the motor system, with each region contributing a distinct function. For example, populations of motor cortical neurons may encode movement direction, whereas the cerebellum and red nucleus provide instructions for timing and amplitude. Second, widespread regions of the motor system contribute to specific behavioral tasks. Both the deep cerebellar nucleus interpositus and its target the red nucleus appear to be specialized for reaching movements that involve a grasp component Van Kan et al., 1994 Gibson et al., 1998 . The pioneering lesion studies of Lawrence and Kuypers 1968a,b and others Sybirska and Gorska, 1980 Martin and Ghez, 1988 have suggested the parallel functions of the corticospinal and rubrospinal pathways in specialized movements of the hand although execution of individual finger movements in monkeys may be specific to the corticospinal inputs . Third, both the rubrospinal and the corticospinal tracts send monosynaptic projections to spinal motoneurons McCurdy et al., 1987 Ralston et al., 1988 thus, direct access to motoneuron pools is not the exclusive domain of the cerebral cortex. Finally, lesions of one pathway can largely compensate for lesions of the other Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968a,b , suggesting a cooperative functional organization among the cortex and cerebellum. Thus, it appears that the corticospinal and rubrospinal systems function much in parallel in mam-mals. Does the emergence of the motor cortex and corticospi-nal tract give rise to a reorganization of motor control in mammals as opposed to non-mammalian vertebrates? The findings of the present study suggest that the organization of the cerebellorubral circuitry is similar between rats and turtles. Both species have dominant inputs from the cerebellum to all parts of the rubrospinal neuron and descending control of the distal dendrites that may serve higher integrative functions. The possibility that there may be indirect cortical control of the reptilian cerebelloru-bral system would suggest that the cortical and cerebellar systems have a common organization in vertebrates. This could reflect similarities in the motor control strategies for controlling the limbs. An instructive example to support this view is how the octopus controls its arm. Although the arm is a muscular-hydrostat with unlimited degrees of freedom, the octopus has simplified the control problem dramatically by using kinematics that resemble human or primate arm movements Gutfreund et al., 1996 . Much like controlling the path of the hand, the trajectory of the bend is stereotypic. Therefore, the optimal strategy for controlling limb movements may have been solved early on by nervous systems by using a combination of feedforward commands and sensory feedback called ââquasi-feedfor-wardââ by Houk et al., 1990 . This basic scheme may simply have been elaborated upon in reptiles, birds, and mam-mals as behavioral complexity expanded. These specula-tions require further physiologic and anatomical analysis. Taken together, these findings suggest that the functional organization of the mammalian and non-mammalian cer-ebellorubrospinal systems may be more similar to one another than has been previously observed. RESULTS The data are from 87 anterogradely labeled terminal boutons from the rat 45 from cerebellar, 23 from hypotha-lamic, and 19 from cortical injections and 39 from the turtle 24 from cerebellar and 15 from hypothalamic injections that were observed to be apposed to the soma or dendritic branches of LY-filled rubrospinal neurons. Such boutons were either directly overlapping with a portion of an LY-filled cell or positioned in direct apposition to the cell membrane. Rubrospinal projection neurons were identi-fied by retrograde labeling from spinal cord injections of FB in rats or by determination of soma size of LY-filled neurons in turtles. The LY-filled neurons from the turtle reported in the present study averaged 28 6 5 Î¼m in the major axis and 21 6 4 in the minor axis means 6 S.D. . These values are well within the range of soma measure-ments of retrogradely labeled turtle rubrospinal neurons that have been reported to be 27 6 5 Î¼m and 16 6 3 Î¼m in the major and minor axes, respectively Keifer et al., 1992 . Thus, we conclude that the LY-filled neurons in the turtle are rubrospinal neurons. General features of red nucleus input organization Injections of the tracer FR into the cerebellum of both rats and turtles targeted the deep cerebellar nuclei. In rats, both the interpositus and dentate nuclei project to the contralateral red nucleus see Discussion . Although the injections were intended for the interpositus, some tracer was invariably located in the dentate therefore, this study does not distinguish between patterns of projections from these two cerebellar nuclei. In turtles, only the lateral nucleus projects to the contralateral red nucleus, whereas the medial nucleus does not therefore, spread of tracer in these experiments was not a confounding factor Bangma et al., 1984 . Multiple injection sites were made into the motor cortex of the rat to label as many of the descending fibers as possible. Placement of tracer substance into the hypothalamus of the rat targeted the lateral hypothalamic area because this region has been previously shown by retrograde tract tracing to send axons to the red nucleus Bernays et al., 1988 . An example of one injection site into the hypothalamus of the rat is shown in the photomicrograph in Figure 1. This area appears to have considerable rostrocaudal extent and is located between the fornix medially and the internal capsule laterally. Cases in which the internal capsule was compromised by the injection were not used in this study to eliminate the possibility that some of these projections were corticospinal fibers. The region of the suprapeduncular nucleus of the hypothala-mus of the turtle was shown by anterograde and retro-grade tract tracing to project to the red nucleus Herrick and Keifer, 1997 , and these injections were repeated in the present study. These injections of FR into the cerebel-lum and hypothalamus of both the rat and turtle and the motor areas of the cerebral cortex in rats resulted in significant anterograde labeling of axons and boutons in the red nucleus. The degree of anterograde label in the red nucleus differed among the different projection sites such that inputs from the cerebellum were generally dense, followed by intermediate label from the hypothalamus in both species, and sparse label from the cortex in rats. Fluoro-Ruby-labeled terminal boutons were clearly vis-ible against the LY-filled somata and dendrites. Photomi-crographs of FR-labeled boutons apposed to LY-filled rubro-spinal neurons are shown for the rat in Figure 2AâC and for the turtle in Figure 2DâF. In the rat, an example of an FR-labeled bouton from an injection into the cerebellum is shown, and it is apposed to the distal portion of an LY-filled dendrite Fig. 2A, arrow . Fluoro-Ruby-labeled boutons from the hypothalamus Fig. 2B and cortex Fig. 2C also appear to be apposed to distal dendrites. In Figure 2C, an FR-labeled bouton overlaps with the LY-filled dendrite arrow and is adjacent to a labeled bouton that is not apposed to the neuron. Anterogradely labeled boutons apposed to LY-filled dendrites of turtle rubrospinal neu-rons are shown in the lower panels of Figure 2. An FR-labeled bouton from the cerebellum overlaps with a distal segment of an LY-filled dendrite Fig. 2D, arrow . A labeled swelling that is not in apparent contact with the dendrite is also visible in the photomicrograph. Boutons labeled by injections into the hypothalamus Fig. 2EâF, arrows are apposed to the distal dendrites of two different LY-filled cells. In Figure 2F, a thin axon can be observed to be attached to the bouton in apposition to the dendrite, and a second swelling is also visible. In addition to the relatively large rubrospinal projection neurons, the red nucleus of both the rat and turtle contains smaller g-aminobutyric acid GABA âimmunoreactive in-terneurons Andre et al., 1987 Keifer et al., 1992 . Intracel-lular fills of these interneurons have not been reported, and their neuronal morphology is largely unknown except for some possible examples from Golgi-stained material King et al., 1971, 1974 . In two fortuitous cases, one each in the rat and turtle, a presumed GABAergic interneuron was filled with LY. The case from the rat Fig. 3AâB and the turtle Fig. 3C are shown in the photomicrographs of Figure 3. Figure 3A shows a low power image of three out-of-focus LY-filled rubrospinal neurons from the rat and the much smaller diameter neuron that was filled in the same tissue. The three larger neurons also contained FB, whereas the smaller neuron did not. Figure 3B shows a higher power image of the small neuron. The soma is ovoid, and the cell has delicate dendrites that ramify either directly from the soma or from a thicker dendritic shaft. The dendrites do not appear to radiate extensively, but it is possible that the neuron was not filled completely with LY. Another small neuron from the turtle that was intracellularly injected with LY is shown in Figure 3C. This neuron is remarkably similar to the one shown in Figure 3B from the rat. It has an ovoid soma with fine dendrites that emerge either from the soma or from a thicker dendritic shaft visible at the top of the image. It too has a dendritic field that does not appear to ramify a great distance. Measurements of the size of the somata showed that the neuron from the rat was 12.8â7.3 Î¼m, whereas the neuron from the turtle was 11.9â8.6 Î¼m major vs. minor axis, respectively . The mean soma size of GABA-immuno-reactive neurons in the turtle was 13â7 Î¼m, whereas the mean size of retrogradely labeled rubrospinal neurons from the turtle was 27â16 Î¼m Keifer et al., 1992 . Based on these data, the small diameter neurons intracellularly filled with LY may be GABAergic interneurons. Quantitative analysis of inputs to rubrospinal neurons The morphologic features of the anterogradely labeled boutons apposed to LY-filled rubrospinal neurons were analyzed quantitatively. To determine the spatial distribu-tion of these potential synaptic inputs onto the dendrites, the distance of each bouton along the dendrite from the edge of the soma was measured from the images. These measure-ments allowed comparisons of the pattern of inputs from the cerebellum, cortex, and hypothalamus to be made for each of the rat or turtle and for comparison of inputs between the two species. Due to the thickness of the sections containing the LY-filled neurons, the dendrites generally did not run parallel to the surface of the image but usually extended at an oblique angle to the plane of section. Thus, because our measurements were made in two dimensions by using an x and y axis, the length of the extension of dendrites was affected by foreshortening in the image. This, in general, would be expected to affect the measure-ments of distally located boutons more so than those more proximally located. Because this was equally true for all of our material, comparisons of the general patterns of bouton distribution from the different projection sites and between species are possible. However, it is likely that some of the boutons located on distal dendrites are actually farther along the dendrite than the measured values indicate. The distance of each measured bouton along the den-drite is plotted in Figure 4. Boutons located on the soma are also indicated S . Each dot represents a single antero- gradely labeled bouton from injections into the cerebellum Cb , hypothalamus Hyp , or cortex Cx for both the rat R and turtle T . These data suggest that inputs from the cerebellum, hypothalamus, and cortex are largely overlap-ping for each of the rat and turtle. Closer scrutiny shows that, in the rat, boutons from the cortex were present on the more distally located dendrites, at a minimum of 42 Î¼m from the edge of the soma. Inputs from the cerebellum and hypothalamus were found on the somata, proximal dendrites, and distal dendrites. Thus, there is specificity of the cortical inputs to more distally located dendrites, but these overlap spatially with those from the cerebellum and hypothalamus. These data are summarized in Table 1, in which a distal dendrite was defined as being located farther than 40 Î¼m from the soma. This value was chosen because boutons from the cortex were not observed in closer proximity to this. Similar findings were observed in the material from the turtle. The inputs from the hypothala-mus were located mainly on the more distally located dendrites, at a minimum of 45 Î¼m from the soma. Boutons from the cerebellum were observed on somata and proxi-mal and distal dendrites. Thus, in the turtle, inputs from the hypothalamus were confined to more distally located dendrites, but these overlap spatially with inputs from the cerebellum. These data from the turtle are also summa-rized in Table 1. The data shown for individual boutons in Figure 4 are plotted as the mean distance on the dendrite for each type of input in Figure 5. In the rat filled bars , cerebellar and hypothalamic boutons averaged 77 Î¼m and 91 Î¼m from the soma, respectively, whereas the cortical inputs were lo-cated significantly more distally at an average of 130 Î¼m from the soma P , 0.05, significant difference of the cortical boutons from those of the cerebellum . In the turtle open bars , the boutons of cerebellar origin averaged 62 Î¼m from the soma, whereas those from the hypothalamus were located significantly more distally at 110 Î¼m P , 0.05 . The spatial distribution of boutons from the rat and turtle cerebellum and from the rat hypothalamus are not significantly different from one another P 5 0.53 . Each of these projections occupy sites on the soma and proximal and distal dendrites of rubrospinal neurons. The distribu-tion of boutons from the rat cortex and turtle hypothala-mus are also not statistically different from each other P 5 0.49 because they occupy primarily the distal dendrites. Recombining the data shows that there are significant differences between the rat cortex and turtle hypothalamus data in one group and between the rat and turtle cerebellum and rat hypothalamus data in the other P , 0.0001 . Thus, the spatial distribution of boutons from the rat cortex and turtle hypothalamus are more similar to one another than they are to any of the other patterns of projections. The diameter of the segment of dendrite apposed to each FR-labeled bouton was analyzed as another way of assess-ing their relative proximal to distal location. Distally located dendrites are often, but not always, smaller in diameter than are more proximal dendrites. Data summa-rizing the diameter of the presumed postsynaptic dendrite apposed to each type of bouton are shown in Figure 6A. In the rat filled bars , dendrites that were opposite boutons from the cerebellum or hypothalamus averaged 4.1 Î¼m and 3.6 Î¼m in diameter, respectively. Those apposed to boutons from the cortex had a considerably smaller diam-eter of 2.0 Î¼m P , 0.01, dendrites apposed to cerebellar inputs vs. cortex P 5 0.07, dendrites apposed to hypotha-lamic inputs vs. cortex . The dendrites in apposition to the hypothalamic boutons in the turtle were of a significantly smaller diameter than those opposite the cerebellar inputs open bars 1.8 Î¼m vs. 3.5 Î¼m, respectively P , 0.05 . These data also suggest that the hypothalamic projection in the turtle is more similar to the cortical projection in the rat than it is to the rat hypothalamic projection. The diameters of the dendrites opposite the cerebellar inputs were similar between the rat and turtle. The diameters of the FR-filled boutons were analyzed to determine whether there were any structural differences between those labeled from the various injection sites. These data are summarized in Figure 6B. Boutons that originated from the turtle cerebellum averaged 1.3 Î¼m in diameter, which was significantly smaller when compared to any of the boutons from the other brain regions P , 0.05 . Boutons from the turtle hypothalamus averaged 1.8 Î¼m in diameter, whereas those from the rat cerebellum were 2.1 Î¼m, those from the rat hypothalamus were 2.2 Î¼m, and those from the cortex averaged 2.1 Î¼m in diameter.

Comp. Neurol."><JournalName>The Journal of comparative neurology</JournalName></Journal><AbstractText>In recent years, several mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been developed. One, caused by a G86R mutation in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) gene associated with familial ALS, has been subjected to extensive quantitative analyses in the spinal cord. However, the human form of ALS includes pathology elsewhere in the nervous system. In the present study, analyses were extended to three motor nuclei in the brainstem. Mutant mice and control littermates were evaluated daily, and mutants, along with their littermate controls, were killed when they were severely affected. Brains were removed after perfusion and processed for Nissl staining, the samples were randomized, and the investigators were blinded to their genetic status. Stereologic methods were used to estimate the number of neurons, mean neuronal volumes, and nuclear volume in three brainstem motor nuclei known to be differentially involved in the human form of the disease, the oculomotor, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei. In the facial nucleus, neuron number consistently declined (48%), an effect that was correlated with disease severity. The nuclear volume of the facial nucleus was smaller in the SOD-1 mutant mice (45.7% difference from control mice) and correlated significantly with neuron number. The oculomotor and hypoglossal nuclei showed less extreme involvement (&lt;10% neuronal loss overall), with a trend toward fewer neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus of animals with severe facial nucleus involvement. In the oculomotor nucleus, neuronal loss was seen only once in five mice, associated with very severe disease.

One, caused by a G86R mutation in the superoxide dismutase-1 SOD-1 gene associated with familial ALS, has been subjected to extensive quantitative analyses in the spinal cord. However, the human form of ALS includes pathology elsewhere in the nervous system. In the present study, analyses were extended to three motor nuclei in the brainstem. Mutant mice and control littermates were evaluated daily, and mutants, along with their littermate controls, were killed when they were severely affected. Brains were removed after perfusion and processed for Nissl staining, the samples were randomized, and the investiga-tors were blinded to their genetic status. Stereologic methods were used to estimate the number of neurons, mean neuronal volumes, and nuclear volume in three brainstem motor nuclei known to be differetially involved in the human form of the disease, the oculomotor, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei. In the facial nucleus, neuron number consistently declined 48% , an effect that was correlated with disease severity. The nuclear volume of the facial nucleus was smaller in the SOD-1 mutant mice 45.7% difference from control mice and correlated significantly with neuron number. The oculomotor and hypoglossal nuclei showed less extreme involvement ,10% neuronal loss overall , with a trend toward fewer neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus of animals with severe facial nucleus involvement. In the oculomotor nucleus, neuronal loss was seen only once in five mice, associated with very severe disease. There was no significant change in the volume of individual neurons in any of these three nuclei in any transgenic mouse. These results suggest that different brainstem motor nuclei are differentially affected in this SOD-1 mutant model of ALS. The relatively moderate and late involvement of the hypoglossal nucleus indicates that, although the general patterns of neuronal pathology match closely those seen in ALS patients, some differences exist in this transgenic model compared with the progression of the disease in humans. However, these patterns of cellular vulnerability may provide clues for understanding the differential susceptibility of neural structures in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 112â125, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is an age-related, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects primar-ily motor neurons Rowland, 1994 Tandan, 1994 . It has an incidence of 1 100,000 in the Caucasian population and occurs as both familial and sporadic forms, with the familial form accounting for approximately 5% of cases Rowland, 1994 Tandan, 1994 . The clinical symptoms and neuropathologic changes are similar in both forms of the disease, indicating that sporadic and familial ALS share pathogenetic mechanisms. The early symptoms of ALS include muscle atrophy, weakness, and fasciculations Rowland, 1994 Tandan, 1994 . The disease progresses over 5 years on average, eventually involves cranial nerve motor nuclei, and has a fatal outcome Rowland, 1994 . Neuropathologically, ALS is characterized by considerable loss of motor neurons in the lower spinal cord and brain-stem, atrophy of the ventral roots, degeneration of the upper motor neurons and corticospinal tracts, neuronal somatic and axonal inclusions of abnormal neurofilament proteins, and astrogliosis Hirano et al., 1967 Hirano, 1991 Leigh and Swash, 1991 . Respiratory muscles are affected late in the course of the disease Rowland, 1994 . Among cranial nerve motoneurons, the most consistent changes are observed in the hypoglossal nucleus, with tongue muscles being affected even in the early stages of the disease, as well as in the trigeminal motor, facial, and in some cases the oculomotor nuclei DePaul et al., 1988 Kiernan and Hudson, 1991 Gizzi et al., 1992 Okamoto et al., 1993 Reiner et al., 1995 . Usually, cranial nerve symptoms include dysarthria and dysphagia facial muscle weakness is less frequent. Mastication is affected late, and ophthalmoplegia is relatively rare. Agenetic linkage of mutations in the Cu21 Zn21 superox-ide dismutase-1 SOD-1 gene has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the development of the familial form ofALS Rosen et al., 1993 . To explore potential alterations in the enzymatic function of mutated SOD-1 and their role in the pathogenesis of ALS, several lines of transgenic mice have been created that have mutations in the human SOD-1 gene or an equivalent mutation in the mouse gene Dal Canto and Gurney 1994, 1995, 1997 Gurney et al., 1994 Ripps et al., 1995 Wong et al., 1995 Bruijn et al., 1997b Morrison et al., 1998c Morrison and Morrison, 1999 . All these SOD-1 mutant mice appear normal at birth but develop motor symptomatology between 90 and 180 days of life, which progresses rapidly to limb paralysis and premature death, and these mice show neuronal pathology in the spinal cord that is reminiscent of the alterations observed in human ALS Morrison et al., 1998c Morrison and Morrison, 1999 . In recent years, we have analyzed transgenic mice with a G86R mutation of the mouse SOD-1 gene that have high expression of this altered gene in the central nervous system and present with an age-related, rapidly progres-sive decline of motor function accompanied by degenera-tive changes of motoneurons within the spinal cord and brainstem Ripps et al., 1995 Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a,b Morrison and Morrison, 1999 . Previous stereo-logic analyses of this G86R SOD-1 transgenic mouse have demonstrated a well-defined pattern of neuropathologic changes in the spinal cord Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a , with a loss of spinal cord neurons that follows a consistent time course Morrison et al., 1998a . No alterations are observed in the spinal cords of presymptomatic mice, but neuronal loss begins at the onset of symptoms, around 100 days of life, and coincides with the appearance of reactive astrogliosis and phosphorylated neurofilament inclusions Morrison et al., 1998a . However, not all of the neuron populations in the anterior horn of the spinal cord are equally affected in this mouse model because neurons containing choline acetyltransferase and neurofilament protein are particularly vulnerable, whereas other neu-rons such as those containing calbindin are resistant Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a . We also reported the occurrence of substantial changes in the trigeminal motor nucleus of these animals Ripps et al., 1995 . In view of the fact that the human forms of ALS include differential involvement of cranial nerve motor nuclei, we have expanded in the present study our quantitative evaluation of neuropathologic changes in G86R mouse mutants to brainstem motor nuclei. We chose three repre-sentative motor nuclei that are known to be differentially affected by the disease in humans. We elected to analyze the facial nucleus in view of its involvement inALS and, as a comparison, the oculomotor nucleus, which is tradition-ally not involved in human forms of ALS. However, be-cause it is possible that the reason the oculomotor nucleus is usually spared is that the patients die before it becomes affected by the degenerative process, we evaluated another nucleus that lies caudally to the facial nucleus, the hypo-glossal nucleus. This also permits one to distinguish the potential for vulnerability of these cranial nerve nuclei based on their anatomic localization in the brainstem and their embryologic origin i.e., motoneuron pools innervat-ing muscles of myomeric origin in the case of the oculomo-tor and hypoglosssal nuclei and of branchiomeric origin in the case of the facial nucleus Brodal, 1981 . Stereologic estimates of total neuronal number, mean volume of individual neurons, and volume of the nuclei were ob-tained in the oculomotor nucleus, the facial nucleus, and the hypoglossal nucleus. In addition, a qualitative survey of the trigeminal motor, trochlear, abducens and ambiguus nuclei was also conducted. A preliminary report of these data has appeared in abstract form Nimchinsky et al., 1998 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue preparation and staining procedure Transgenic mice with a G86R mutation of the mouse SOD-1 gene and control FVB littermates were used in this study. The transgenic mice were developed by introducing a missense mutation Gly86 Arg into the fourth exon of a 15-kb mouse genomic clone, as previously described Ripps et al., 1995 . We evaluated 10 FVB mice older than 100 days five G86R transgenic and five littermate con-trols, of either sex Table 1 . This time point was chosen based on previous analyses of the SOD-1 transgenic mouse Ripps et al., 1995 Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a,b .Animals were evaluated clinically and weighed daily from the age of 90 days, prior to the development of motor symptomatol-ogy in the mutant animals. Mice were rated for their ability to run, move spontaneously, groom, and explore. The precise point of death was determined by the loss of use of hindlimbs and rapid weight loss in spite of full access to food and water. This time point was within 2 days of expected death based on previous observations Ripps et al., 1995 Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a,b . The number of animals included in the study was determined by the estimates of biological variance obtained during the course of data acquisition. No systematic attempt was made to evaluate cranial nerve nuclei function in these animals, although, in two of the cases included in this study, eye infection arose at end stage, possibly reflecting the involve-ment of the facial and oculomotor musculature, in addition to the loss of forelimb use, that is also needed for grooming. All mice were perfused transcardially. Briefly, they were deeply anesthetized with 0.1 ml of an equal mixture of ketamine 100 mg ml and xylazine 20 mg ml , the chest was then opened the heart exposed, and the mice were perfused with cold 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 1 minute followed by cold 4% paraformal-dehyde for 10 minutes. Brains and spinal cords were removed, and the brains were carefully hemisected, cryo-protected, and cut on a sliding microtome or a cryostat at 40 Î¼m. The sections were kept in strict anatomical order for stereologic purposes, and a 1 4 series through the entire hemisphere and brainstem was stained with cresyl violet for cytoarchitecture and neuronal morphometry in each animal. Proper identification of the nuclear bound-aries was confirmed by using available mouse brain at-lases as a reference Sidman et al., 1971 Franklin and Paxinos, 1997 . All experimental protocols were conducted within NIH guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-mittee at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Stereologic analyses Quantitative analyses were performed on a computer-assisted image analysis system consisting of a Zeiss Ax-iophot photomicroscope equipped with a Zeiss MSP65 computer-controlled motorized stage, a Zeiss ZVS-47E video camera, a Macintosh 840AV microcomputer, and NeuroZoom, a custom-designed morphology and stereol-ogy software developed in collaboration between Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Scripps Research Insti-tute Bloom et al., 1997 Young et al., 1997 . This system possesses infinite xâyâz mapping capacity that is re-stricted only by the physical limits of the microscope stage, a full stereology package, and the ability to keep the three-dimensional coordinates of objects at different levels of resolution, thereby enabling the user to switch between magnifications during mapping. This latter feature is particularly useful when defining the boundary of a struc-ture at low magnification before performing a stereologic analysis at high magnification Bloom et al., 1997 Young et al., 1997 . All analyses used standard, accepted stereo-logic formulas Howard and Reed, 1998 , using the built-in point-counting, optical fractionator and rotator protocols in NeuroZoom, and were performed blind to the genotype and phenotype of the animals by use of an encrypted code. Estimates of neuron numbers were obtained by using the optical fractionator, and volume measurements were obtained with the Cavalieri estimator of volume and the rotator method West et al., 1991, 1996 Vedel-Jensen and Gundersen, 1993 . In the NeuroZoom software, the rotator can be conveniently coupled with the fractionator, so that neuronal counts can be retrieved with an estimate of the mean cellular volume of the neuronal population of inter-est. From a random starting point, a 1 4 series of sections was sampled throughout the entirety of structures of interest yielding four to six sections per nucleus, depend-ing on the case . After outlining the boundaries of the nucleus on the computer graphic display in each section separately, the NeuroZoom software placed within each laminar boundary a set of optical disector frames 30 3 30 Î¼m in a systematic random fashion, corresponding to a predetermined percentage of the sampled area that was kept constant throughout the study Fig. 1 . In this case, 10% of the facial nucleus, 50% of the hypoglossal nucleus, and 35% of the oculomotor nucleus was sampled. Neurons were then counted in each stack of optical disectors each disector was 2 Î¼m deep , according to stereologic prin- ciples. The thickness of these disector stacks, termed ââmultisectorsââ in NeuroZoom software Bloom et al., 1997 Young et al., 1997 , was kept constant within each animal and was set at 6 Î¼m in the present study.Arotator analysis was performed at the same time on each counted neuron. For this analysis, the vertical axis was a line running strictly superior to inferior with respect to the brain Fig. 1 . We did not use isotropic uniform random sections in this study due to the nature of the materials, but this is not likely to generate a significant error in volume estimates obtained from conventional coronal sections, as demon-strated by a recent study comparing the rotator on the two types of sections Schmitz et al., 1999 . Only neurons whose nuclei was within the counting frame or in contact with its permitted edges were counted, and the nucleolus was consistently chosen as a reference landmark for determining the focal plane for rotator analysis. Optical fractionator and rotator analyses were per-formed with a 1.4 numerical aperture 1003 Plan-Neo-Fluar Zeiss objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture auxil-iary condenser lens to achieve optimal optical sectioning during disector analysis. Cavalieri estimators of structure volumes were performed at low magnification 103 by using a point-counting grid, with the area associated with each point set at 2,500 Î¼m2. Volume estimates were all obtained on histochemically processed sections that under-went considerable shrinkage in all three dimensions. No correction factor was applied to the volumetric data. To assess whether neurons of a particular size were preferen-tially lost in the mutant mice, the individual cellular volumes were plotted in size bins of 1,000-Î¼m3 increments, and their distribution was compared between mutant and control mice in each nucleus. The relations between total neuronal number among the three brainstem nuclei and between total neuronal number in the different nuclei and nuclear and mean neuronal volumes were also assessed. Statistical analysis was performed with a Studentâs t-test, an F test, and tests of correlation. Coefficients of error and variation were calculated according to the method de-scribed by West et al. 1996 . DISCUSSION The present results complement our original description of the G86R mouse in which we reported widespread changes in the motor system, including brainstem struc-tures such as the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve Ripps et al., 1995 . These data also provide quantitative information on the brainstem, a region that has not been studied in detail in most SOD-1 transgenic models of ALS DalCanto and Gurney, 1994, 1995, 1997 Gurney et al., 1994 Ripps et al., 1995 Wong et al., 1995 Bruijn et al., 1997a,b and in parallel previous quantitative analyses of motoneurons and interneurons in the spinal cord of the same mouse model Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a . Al-though the facial nucleus is severely affected, the oculomo-tor and hypoglossal nuclei are spared until late in this mouse model, and the trochlear, abducens, and ambiguus nuclei show no alterations in the mutant mice, indicating that all three oculomotor nuclei and the neurons innervat-ing the pharyngeal, laryngeal and upper esophageal, and tongue musculature remain largely unaffected at least until the end stage of the disease. These patterns also show that there is no correlation between the vulnerability of a particular group of neurons and its embryologic origin, myomeric or branchiomeric. The severe neuronal loss in the facial nucleus and the sparing of the oculomotor nucleus in all but one transgenic mouse and the assessment of the trigeminal motor, troch-lear, and abducens nuclei demonstrate that the G86R mouse is a reliable model of pathologic changes in the brainstem in human ALS. The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei are not consistently affected in human ALS, and oculomotor function is generally spared at least until the terminal stages of the disease, although a few cases with ophthalmoplegia and neuronal loss in the oculomotor nuclei have been documented Harvey et al., 1979 Leveille et al., 1982 Leigh and Swash, 1991 Gizzi et al., 1992 Marti-Fabregas and Roig, 1992 Okamoto et al., 1993 Rowland, 1994 Tandan, 1994 . In contrast, the motor trigeminal, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei are in-volved more severely and early in the course of the disease DePaul et al., 1988 Kiernan and Hudson, 1991 . How-ever, it should be noted that the involvement of the ambiguus and hypoglossal nuclei does not seem to be a prominent feature of this model, whereas ALS patients consistently present with severe deficits of tongue motility and with dysphagiaâdysarthria DePaul et al., 1988 Kier-nan and Hudson, 1991 Leigh and Swash, 1991 Rowland, 1994 . Previous work has demonstrated that a considerable decrease in the total number of neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord about 24% occurs in approxi-mately 100-day-old G86R mice, at which age large num-bers of neurons show pathologic inclusions of neurofila-ment proteins Morrison et al., 1998a . Interestingly, this loss involves both motoneurons and interneurons, and these subpopulations appear to be comparably affected, with a 29% decrease in the number of motoneurons and a 24% decrease in the number of interneurons. If the neuron counts are taken from animals that are fully symptomatic with paralysis of forelimbs and hindlimbs, rather than based on the chronological age of 100 days, then the mean total neuron loss is slightly higher in the ventral horn of the spinal cord 35% Morrison et al., 1996 . Thus, al-though neuron loss at 100 days is quantitatively more extensive in the facial nucleus than in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, a quantitatively detectable loss of neurons in the spinal cord occurs with the same time course as in the brainstem, suggesting that, in these mice, pathologic changes develop at approximately the same tempo in different levels of the neuraxis and that the disease does not affect preferentially the rate of loss of specific neuronal subpopulations with respect to onset of degeneration Mor-rison et al., 1998a . The possible involvement of the upper motor neurons has not yet been established quantitatively in these mice, but previous evidence has demonstrated the existence of a few degenerating neurons in layer V of the primary motor cortex Ripps et al., 1995 . Therefore, it is likely that some pathologic changes also occur in the primary motor cortex that may not be as severe as the substantial alterations observed in the populations of lower motoneurons investigated thus far. Previous analy-ses from our laboratory have shown that not all interneu-rons are equally affected by this SOD-1 mutation because those containing the calcium-binding protein calbindin are resistant to the degenerative process, whereas those con-taining calretinin are selectively vulnerable Morrison et al., 1996 . The present study did not investigate interneu-rons and motoneurons separately therefore, we do not know whether these different neuronal groups are differen-tially affected in cranial nerve nuclei. However, the fact that no particular neuronal size group was found to be more prone to degeneration in the mutant mice suggests that, as in the spinal cord, large motoneurons and smaller interneurons are comparably involved in the affected brainstem motor nuclei. Although there is no consensus about the exact mecha-nisms by which the presence of a mutation on the SOD-1 gene influences the cellular function of the SOD-1 protein Bruijn et al., 1998 Morrison and Morrison, 1999 , it has been proposed that these mutations induce pathology through gain of function rather than through loss of function of the protein Gurney et al., 1994 Ripps et al., 1995 . This hypothesis is based on the facts that SOD-1 knockout mice do not develop lesions or symptoms in the absence of SOD-1-related clearance of superoxide radicals, mutated SOD-1 does not show a reduced capacity of its normal function of clearing superoxide radicals, and SOD-1 transgenic mice all show normal to high levels of the classical reaction catalyzed by SOD-1, indicating that mutated SOD-1 has gained functional capacities not shared by the wild-type protein Borchelt et al., 1994 Gurney et al., 1994 Nishida et al., 1994 Tsuda et al., 1994 Fujii et al., 1995 Ripps et al., 1995 Wong et al., 1995 Reaume et al., 1996 Bruijn et al., 1997a Morrison and Morrison, 1999 . Although the toxic effects of mutated SOD-1 could result from some property of SOD-1 aggregates commonly observed in affected mutant lines Bruijn et al., 1998 , three potential gains of function have been demonstrated thus far for mutated SOD-1 facilitation of peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration of proteins, increased peroxi- dase reaction, and increased capacity of binding to specific cellular proteins Abe et al., 1995 Cleveland et al., 1996 Wiedau-Pazos et al., 1996 Yim et al., 1996 Beal et al., 1997 Bruijn et al., 1997a Ferrante et al., 1997 Kunst et al., 1997 . Furthermore, many cellular abnormalities have been described that appear to result from SOD-1 muta-tions in transgenic animals and in ALS patients, such as accumulation of neurofilament proteins, disruption of the morphology of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria, and a deficit in both slow and fast axonal transport Hirano et al., 1967 Hirano, 1991 Leigh and Swash, 1991 Dal Canto and Gurney, 1994, 1995 Wong et al., 1995 Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a Mourelatos et al., 1996 Tu et al., 1996 Zhang et al., 1997 Kong and Xu, 1998 Williamson and Cleveland, 1999 . Abnormal gains of function may interact with such cellular functional alterations and lead to increased vulnerability in certain neuronal populations. The fact that calcium-binding protein-containing neu-rons are differentially affected in the G86R mice is impor-tant in the context of the possible mechanisms implicated in the degenerative process. Clearly not all neurons are equally affected in ALS and in transgenic models of ALS. The present data and previous work on the spinal cord of the same mouse model show that on average about 50% of the neurons are subject to degeneration and eventually die, suggesting that some neuronal populations are pro-tected against the deleterious effects of the SOD-1 muta-tion, even in the regions affected by the disease process. Affected mice may die once 50% of the more vulnerable neurons are affected, before any alterations can occur in other neuronal populations. In this context, it is possible that the presence of calcium-binding proteins confer a resistance to degeneration in certain neurons, as has been demonstrated in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâs disease Hof and Morrison, 1999 Hof et al., 1999 . Intracellular calcium levels play an important role in neurodegeneration and have been shown to correlate with the degree of motoneuron degeneration in SOD-1 mutant mice Siklo Â´s et al., 1998 . In the spinal cord of the G86R mouse, stereologic studies have shown that calbindin-containing interneurons are highly resistant to degenera-tion even in end-stage animals with severe neuronal loss Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a . Calbindin has a high capacity for intracellular calcium buffering and is present in subsets of neurons that are resistant to neurodegenera-tion throughout the brain Mattson et al., 1991 Lledo et al., 1992 Andressen et al., 1993 Chard et al., 1993 . Interestingly, it has also been shown that calbindin can protect motor neurons from the toxicity of serum obtained from ALS patients Alexianu et al., 1994 Ho et al., 1996 . Furthermore, another calcium-binding protein, parvalbu-min, has been shown to be present in resistant neurons in ALS and is localized in brainstem structures that are usually less affected by the disease process Alexianu et al., 1994 Elliott and Snider, 1995 Reiner et al., 1995 . It is noteworthy that in primates 85â100% of the neurons in the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei contain parvalbumin, whereas only 20â30% of the neurons in the trigeminal, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei show parvalbu- min immunoreactivity Reiner et al., 1995 . This pattern of parvalbumin distribution matches the differential vulner-ability of brainstem motor nuclei observed in the present study. It is worth noting that in another rodent, the rat, the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei contain high densities of parvalbumin-and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons only parvabumin is observed in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas these calcium-binding proteins are not observed in the trigeminal motor, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei Celio, 1990 . Also in the rat, the brainstem motor nuclei do not contain calretinin Re Â´sibois and Rogers, 1992 therefore, calretinin may not contribute to the resistance or vulnreability of neurons in these regions. This contrasts with the spinal cord of both rats and mice, where large calretinin-containing interneurons have been reported Ren and Ruda, 1994 Morrison et al., 1996, 1998a . In spite of species and regional differences in the distribution of these proteins, it is possible that the presence of a given calcium-binding protein in certain motoneuron pools in this case, the three oculomotor nuclei confers resistance to the degenerative process induced by SOD-1 mutation in transgenic animals and in patients with the familial form of the disease. In addition to calcium-binding proteins, intracellular calcium concentration and calcium fluxes are influenced by several factors. For instance, the presence of certain glutamate receptor proteins critically determine calcium permeability. Whereas N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA re-ceptors are permeable to calcium, the glutamate receptor subunit 2 GluR2 of the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors prevent calcium fluxes through these receptors Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994 . Interestingly, there is a reduced expression of the calcium-gating subunit GluR2 in human motor neurons, which may explain in part the increased vulnerability of these neurons to calcium-mediated toxicity in ALS Shaw et al., 1999 . In addition, motoneurons are selectively affected by NMDA-induced neurotoxicity Annis and Vaughn, 1998 , and glutamate has been shown to potentiate the effects of SOD-1 mutations in transgenic mice through calcium-dependent mechanisms Roy et al., 1998 . However, GluR2 immunoreactivity appears to be present in nearly all neurons of the spinal cord in G86R mice, and immunoelec-tron microscopic analyses have demonstrated that GluR2 occurs at synapses of both vulnerable and resistant neu-rons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord in these mice Morrison et al., 1998b . Consequently, GluR2 is unlikely to be a determining factor in the pathogenesis of SOD-1-related changes in the G86R mouse. However, other fac-tors such as NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity An-nis and Vaughn, 1998 , the presence of differential representation of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and relatively low calcium buffering capacity of certain brainstem motoneuron subpopulations such as the facial and hypoglossal nuclei Lipps and Keller, 1998 Plant et al., 1998 may confer selective vulnerability to these neurons and possibly interact with the abnormal function of mutated SOD-1 Morrison and Morrison, 1999 . Addi-tional factors, such as the loss in ALS of astroglial and neuronal glutamate transporters, may result in increased extracellular concentrations of glutamate in structures particularly vulnerable to the effects of mutated SOD-1 Rothstein et al., 1995 Medina et al., 1996 .Although all of these factors are likely to contribute to the pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to neuronal loss in this mouse model, the mechanisms of mutated SOD-1-mediated pathol-ogy remain poorly understood. Additional studies are necessary to define the neurochemical characteristics of the neurons at risk in brainstem motor nuclei and assess whether specific molecular and morphologic features deter-mine a generic profile of motoneuron vulnerability in ALS. RESULTS Qualitative observations The three motor nuclei investigated in the present study are fairly conspicuous in the mouse brainstem and have easily identifiable boundaries on Nissl-stained materials Sidman et al., 1971 Franklin and Paxinos, 1997 Figs. 2â4 . The oculomotor nucleus Fig. 2 contains densely packed neurons immediately adjacent to the midline and dorsal to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. It is readily distinguishable from the thin, vertically oriented Edinger-Westphal nucleus and from the smaller and lightly stained supraoculomotor portion of the central gray. The facial nucleus Fig. 3 is located ventrally and lies immediately posteriorly and caudally to the superior olivary complex. It extends rostrocaudally slightly more than 1 mm and is composed of about six groups of large motoneurons inner-vating the different facial muscles. In the present analysis, these groups of facial motoneurons were pooled, and no attempt was made to assess whether a particular subpopu-lation of facial motoneurons was more severely affected in the mutant mice. The hypoglossal nucleus Fig. 4 consists of an elongated column of darkly Nissl-stained, large neurons adjacent to the midline in the dorsomedial aspect of the medulla. The hypoglossal motoneurons form several small groups that were grouped together during analysis. These neurons are easily distinguished from the ventrally located nucleus of Roller and from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, dorsally, that are not as intensely Nissl-stained and contain smaller neurons Barnard, 1960 Uemura-Sumi et al., 1988 . Qualitatively, the most consistent changes in the G86R mutant mice were observed in the facial nucleus. These alterations included a substantial loss of the large neurons compared with control littermates Fig. 3B,D . On Nissl-stained sections, the morphology of the remaining facial motoneurons was comparable in the mutant and control mice. The oculomotor and hypoglossal nuclei displayed no obvious histopathologic changes in four of five mutant mice Figs. 2B,D, 4B,D . However, there was an apparent neuronal loss in several sections from the most severely affected G86R mouse mouse S, Table 1 . A qualitative evaluation of the trigeminal motor nucleus showed moder-ate depletion of neurons in all mutant mice Fig. 5A,B , thus confirming previous observations Ripps et al., 1995 . In contrast, no consistent changes were observed in the trochlear and abducens nuclei, indicating that the three oculomotor nuclei were somewhat spared by the degenera- tive process, at least until stages of the disease later than those that could be examined in the present study Figs. 2, 5C,D . The nucleus ambiguus did not show any visible neuron loss Fig. 5E,F , suggesting that, in contrast to humans, early involvement of the pharyngeal and laryn-geal motricity is unlikely to occur in these mice. Stereologic analyses Optical fractionator. The quantitative analysis of this SOD-1 mouse model showed that motor brainstem nuclei were differentially affected by the mutation Table 2 . Only the neurons of the facial nucleus underwent consistently severe alterations and showed a statistically significant loss in the affected mice compared with control littermates. However, not all of the mutant mice showed the same severity of changes in the facial nucleus, al-though they all presented with clear motor somatic symp-toms, and the mice with the most severe clinical presenta-tion were those with the most severe neuronal loss in this nucleus Fig. 3 . Optical fractionator analyses of the number of neurons in the G86R mice showed an overall 48% loss compared with that in control mice P 5 0.0012 Table 2 . The least affected mutant mouse G had a total neuron number in the facial nucleus that was close to the range of value in the control mice, with only a 16% loss, whereas the most severely affected mice displayed 51â72% cell loss Table 2 . Consistent neuronal loss was observed in the oculomotor nucleus only in the two most severely affected animals mice A and S, Table 2 , which had a 28.4% and a 44% neuron loss, respectively, compared with the control group. The counts in mouse A fell just within the range of those of the control mice Table 2 . Overall, the neuronal loss in the oculomotor nucleus was only 6% because the three other mutant mice had neuron numbers falling well within the range of values observed in controls Table 2 , which indicates that the oculomotor nucleus is likely to be affected only late in the disease. Neuron loss was also observed in the hypoglossal nucleus, but it was more variable and and much milder than the loss in the facial nucleus. Overall, neuron loss reached only 7.4% compared with the mean value of total neuronal numbers in control mice, and two mutant mice had neuron counts within the range of controls mice G and Y . The most severe neuronal loss was observed in mouse S, where it reached 31% Table 2 , suggesting that significant hypoglos-sal dysfunction is likely to take place in advanced disease. Correlations of neuronal numbers among all three nuclei were not statistically significant if both groups of mice were considered Fig. 6 . However, when separating con-trol and mutant mice, there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between the number of neurons in the oculomotor and the hypoglossal nuclei in the control mice P , 0.004 Fig. 7 . This correlation disappeared in the SOD-1 mutants. Interestingly, in the mutant mice, there was a statistically significant correlation between neuron numbers in the facial nucleus, which is severely affected, and the hypoglossal nucleus P , 0.002 Fig. 7 . This correlation may indicate a trend toward neuronal loss in the hypoglossal nucleus in the SOD-1 mutants, which parallels that seen in the facial nucleus but is generally less severe. The neuronal loss in the hypoglossal nucleus could explain why the correlation between the oculomotor and hypoglossal counts was no longer observed in the mutant mice. Cavalieri estimator of nuclear volume. The volume of the facial nucleus was reduced in the five mutant mice by 45.7% on average P , 0.001 , with a range of 29.2â 70.4% compared with the value in control animals Table 3 . The volume of the oculomotor nucleus was not affected in the mutant mice 7.3% change on average . This statisti-cally nonsignificant difference was due mostly to mouse S, which had the only volume outside of the range of the controls 26.1% smaller than the mean value of the control group Table 3 . The volume of the hypoglossal nucleus was found to be smaller only in mice P and S, which also had the lowest neuronal numbers, by 49.3 and 37.9%, respec-tively Table 3 . Overall, a 15.3% difference in hypoglossal nucleus volume was found between mutant and control mice, which was not statistically significant Table 3 . Neuronal numbers were correlated in a statistically signifi-cant manner with the nuclear volume only in the facial nucleus P , 0.001 Fig. 6 , which was considerably smaller in the mutant mice. Rotator analysis. Individual neuron volumes ranged from 932 to 12,453 Î¼m3 in the oculomotor nucleus, from 879 to 16,340 Î¼m3 in the facial nucleus, and from 970 to 18,786 Î¼m3 in the hypoglossal nucleus in the control mice. These values were 872â11,250 Î¼m3 in the oculomotor nucleus, 943â13,537 Î¼m3 in the facial nucleus, and 956â 16,478 Î¼m3 in the hypoglossal nucleus, respectively, in the G86R mutant animals. In both the control and the trans-genic mice, the neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus were on average larger than those in the oculomotor and facial nuclei Fig. 8 Table 4 . These differences reached 42.4% P , 0.01 and 26.3% P , 0.05 compared with the oculomotor and facial nuclei, respectively, in control mice, and 33.1% P , 0.01 and 21.4% not significant , respec-tively, in mutant mice. Differences of mean neuronal volumes of 21.8% and 13% were observed between the facial and oculomotor nuclei in control and mutant mice, respectively not significant, Fig. 8 Table 4 . However, although no statistically significant differences in the distribution of neuronal volumes were observed between control and mutant mice, in the three motor nuclei ana-lyzed in this study, the transgenic mice tended to have slightly lower numbers of large neurons and a marginal increase in the proportion of small neurons Fig. 8 . This shift in the distribution of neuronal size was most appar-ent in hypoglossal nucleus, where neurons were 23% smaller in the mutant mice. This difference did not reach statistical significance and could be accounted for by relatively small variations 1â5% distributed across all size bins Fig. 8 . Therefore, it is likely that there is no significant neuronal shrinkage and no loss of any particu-lar neuron size type in the G86R mouse. Also, no statisti-cally significant correlation was observed between neuro-nal numbers and mean neuronal volume in either mutant or control mice Table 4 Fig. 6 . Therefore, substantial degree of shrinkage of the facial nucleus is likely due to the severe neuronal loss in this structure. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. B.M.

Neurol. 416 540â550, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. In mammals, up to 1,000 genes are believed to encode odorant receptors Buck and Axel, 1991 . Receptors typi-cally have a mosaic expression pattern, and neurons expressing a specific odorant receptor project axons that converge onto one to three glomeruli in topographically fixed locations within the olfactory bulb Ressler et al., 1994 Vassar et al., 1994 . The molecular mechanisms underlying growth of olfactory axons along the olfactory nerve, sorting of axons in the nerve fibre layer of the olfactory bulb, and then guidance to glomeruli are not well understood. Galectin-1 Puche et al., 1996 , odorant recep-tors Mombaerts et al., 1996 , and N-CAM Treloar et al., 1997 have been implicated in axon growth and guidance in the olfactory nerve pathway. In vitro studies indicate that olfactory nerve ensheathing cells Key et al., 1996 , laminin Kafitz and Greer, 1997 , and axonal surface carbohydrates Puche and Key, 1996 Puche et al., 1997 are highly conducive substrates for primary olfactory axon growth. Chemoinhibitory molecules, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, may also influence the growth of olfactory axons Treloar et al., 1996 . Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases have chemorepulsive effects on axon growth and have been implicated in axon pathfinding and the establishment of topographic maps Cheng et al., 1995 Drescher et al., 1995 Holash and Pasquale, 1995 Kenny et al., 1995 Winslow et al., 1995 Marcus et al., 1996 . The Eph-related receptors consist of two subfamilies the EphA receptors, which bind the ephrinAglycosyl phosphatidylinositol GPI -linked cell surface ligands and the EphB receptors, which bind the ephrin B transmembrane ligands Gale et al., 1996 . Within each subfamily, receptors are promiscuous and can bind several different ligands and, conversely, each ligand can bind several different receptors. For example, the EphA receptor binds to five different GPI-linked ligands, ephrins A1âA5 Winslow et al., 1995 Gale et al., 1996 . Thus, there are potentially many different types of interactions between the receptors and ligands, of which the functional consequences of only a few are understood. EphA5 is widely expressed by neurons, whereas, at least in the cortex, ephrin-A5 appears to be expressed by astrocytes Meima et al., 1997 . Interactions between EphA5 and ephrin-A5 cause cortical axons to be repelled from astrocytes Winslow et al., 1995 Meima et al., 1997 . Consequently, these axons prefer to grow on each other and self-fasciculate rather than grow on the surface of astrocytes. Within the chick tectum, ephrinA ligands are expressed in different domains, with ephrin-A5 being expressed more anteriorly than ephrin-A2 Cheng et al., 1995 . These ligands have been shown to act as repellents that affect retinal ganglion cell axons in vitro Drescher et al., 1995 Nakamoto et al., 1996 Monschau et al., 1997 , and in mice with a targeted deletion of ephrin-A5, retinal ganglion cell axons had aberrant targeting consistent with ephrin-A5 acting as a repellent Frise Â´n et al., 1998 . Thus, the differential expression of ephrinA ligands combined with differential ligand binding specifici-ties of EphA receptors may provide sufficient signalling for establishing the retinotectal topographic map. Previous studies have identified mRNA transcripts of EphA5 in the mitral and granule cell layers of olfactory bulb in adult mouse and rat Maisonpierre et al., 1993 Zhou et al., 1994, Zhang et al., 1996 . To assess the role of EphA5 and its ligands in the rat olfactory system, we first describe the expression pattern of these proteins in both the embryonic and adult olfactory nerve pathway and olfactory bulb. Our subsequent studies of neurite out-growth from explant cultures of olfactory neuroepithelium suggest that EphA5âligand interactions play an important role in optimising axon outgrowth in the embryonic olfac-tory nerve pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal preparation Embryos were taken from timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, with the day of a positive vaginal plug referred to as E0.5. Three embryos were taken for each age from E12.5 to E20.5. Pregnant female rats were anaesthe-tised with Nembutal 80 Î¼l 100g body weight Boehringer Ingelheim, Indianapolis, IN and embryos were removed from the uterus and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde PFA in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4, for up to 24 hours at 4Â°C. Heads of postnatal rats P0.5âP5.5 killed by decapitation and heads of adults anaesthetised and killed by decapitation were similarly fixed. Adult heads were decalcified in 20% EDTA.After fixation, tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose with 0.1% sodium azide, placed in embedding matrix O.C.T. compound, Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL , and snap frozen by immer-sion in isopentane that had been cooled by liquid nitrogen. Tissues were stored at 270Â°C until use. Serial sagittal or coronal sections 30 Î¼m were cut on a cryostat microtome, collected on slides coated with 2% gelatine and 0.1% chromalum, air dried overnight, and stored at 225Â°C. The treatment of animals was carried out in with the approval of and in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne. Explant cultures Explants of olfactory neuroepithelium were obtained from embryonic rats E20.5 . Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetised with Nembutal and the embryos were removed from the uterus. The embryos were decapi-tated and the neuroepithelium and nasal septum were dissected and placed in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle medium DMEM, Sigma Chemical Corporation, St. Louis, MO cooled on ice. The neuroepithelium was then cut into approximately 1 mm2 pieces. Inserts Millipore, Bedford, MA were precoated with Matrigel 1 8 Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA overnight at room temperature and washed with PBS, followed by DMEM. The explants were incubated in the inserts nine explants per insert in DMEM with Monomed serum-free hybrid-oma supplement Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, CSL, Melbourne, VIC, Australia and fetal bovine serum FBS 10% vol vol, CSL at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. The medium was removed and replaced with DMEM Monomed FBS with cytosine arabinoside 10 Î¼M Sigma Chemical Corp. and bromophenyl bromide 10 Î¼M Sigma Chemical Corp. and incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. The explants were then fixed with 4% PFA for 30 minutes before immunostaining. To investigate the role of EphA5âligand interactions, explant cultures of olfactory neuroepithelium were treated with each of the following polyclonal rabbit IgG against EphA5 30, 60, 80 Î¼g ml Winslow et al., 1995 polyclonal rabbit IgG against Hek7 0.25, 2.5 Î¼g ml Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA normal rabbit serum ,60 Î¼g Ig ml soluble EphA5-IgG fusion protein contain-ing the extracellular domain of EphA5 30, 60, 90 Î¼g ml Winslow et al., 1995 and soluble ephrin-A5-IgG fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of ephrin-A5 90 Î¼g ml Winslow et al., 1995 . To determine whether the polyclonal antibodies caused clustering of EphA5 on the neurites, anti-EphA5 was added to the medium of explants that had grown for 3 days in the standard medium. After 2 hoursâ incubation with the anti-EphA5, the explants were fixed and immunostained with anti-EphA5 as described below. Immunohistochemistry and ligand histochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described Key and Akeson, 1993 . For detection of EphA5 on cryostat sections, tissue was incubated for 5 minutes with 0.05% H2O2 in methanol to remove endogenous peroxidase activity and then was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin BSA Sigma Chemical Corp. with 0.3% Triton X-100 TX in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline TBS , pH 7.4. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4Â°C with polyclonal rabbit IgG against EphA5 anti-EphA5, Wins-low et al., 1995 anti-Hek7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology at a concentration of 1.5â6.7 Î¼g ml in 2% BSA and 0.3% TX in TBS. Sections were then washed with TBS with TX and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobu-lin antibodies Sigma Chemical Corp. in the same buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed with TBS and incubated with avidinâbiotinâhorseradish peroxidase Vectastain Elite ABC kit Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA for 1 hour at room temperature. Staining was visualised by reaction with diaminobenzidine and H2O2 in TBS. For localisation of receptor binding to ligand, tissue was fixed and prepared as described in the Animal Preparation section above and cryostat sections of E13.5âE20.5 were incubated with H2O2 in methanol as above and then blocked with 2% BSA in TBS postnatal and adult cryostat sections were not incubated with H2O2 in methanol. Sec-tions were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with soluble EphA5-IgG fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of EphA5 Winslow et al., 1995 at a concentration of 5 Î¼g ml in 2% BSA in TBS. Sections were then fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes, washed with TBS, and then incubated with biotinylated Fc fragment specific goat anti-human Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed with TBS and incubated with avidinâbiotinâ horseradish peroxidase for 1 hour at room temperature. Staining was visualised by reaction with diaminobenzi-dine and H2O2 in TBS. Photographs of the cryostat sections were taken on an Olympus BH2 microscope fitted with differential inference contrast optics. Color 35-mm slides or black and white photographs were scanned on a Polaroid SpiritScan35 scanner and converted into digital form using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA . For detection of EphA5 and EphA5-fusion protein bind-ing on explant cultures, the fixed explants were washed with PBS and reacted with anti-EphA5 or EphA5-IgG, followed by the secondary antibodies as above. Staining was visualised by incubating the explants with anti-biotin ExtrAvidin-TRITC conjugate fluorescent antibody Sigma Chemical Corp. for 1 hour at room temperature. For the EphA5-ligand interaction explant culture experiment, the fixed explants were washed with PBS and reacted with polyclonal rabbit antiserum against N-CAM Akeson et al., 1988 , followed by goat anti-rabbit-florescein isothiocya-nate conjugate fluorescent antibody Sigma Chemical Corp. for 1 hour at room temperature. Images of the explants were captured by confocal laser scanning micros-copy MRC 1024, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA using a ZeissAxioplan 2 microscope. Serial optical sections were imaged at 5-Î¼m intervals and were projected to give a two-dimensional reconstruction. Images were assembled into montages using CorelDraw. Quantification of neurite outgrowth The neurite outgrowth in the explant cultures was quantified by two methods first by determining the total area of axons, and second by counting the number of axon bundles. To quantify the area of axons, black-and-white montages of the explants were binarised and the area between the entire edge of the explant and the ends of all the axon bundles was analysed using an image analysis computer package Image-Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD . Axons that grew over the top of the explant were not included in the quantification. The total pixel area covered by axons was then determined. This analysis provided the actual area occupied by axon bundles and did not include the spaces between bundles. To quantify the number of bundles of axons, all separate axon bundles, regardless of thickness, were counted around the perimeter of the explant at 100 Î¼m annular intervals from the edge of the explant. The data were analysed by a one-way analysis of variance and Tukeyâs multiple compari-son Minitab, State College, PA . DISCUSSION This study demonstrates expression of EphA5 and its ligands in the developing olfactory nerve pathway of rat. Both EphA5 and its ligands were coexpressed by primary olfactory neurons without graded or complementary expres-sion patterns during embryonic development. Eph recep-tors and its ligands are frequently not coexpressed by axons. Instead, EphA5 is usually expressed on axons, whereas its ligands are expressed on either astrocytes or postsynaptic target neurons Friedman and OâLeary, 1996 Zhou, 1997 . Consequently, EphA5âligand interactions mediate chemorepulsive responses that direct axons away from inappropriate target sites Winslow et al., 1995 Gao et al., 1996 Meima et al., 1997 . However, EphA receptors have been shown to be colocalised on retinal ganglion cells with EphAligands and may provide a mechanism whereby differential coexpression of ligands may alter the sensitiv-ity of axons to gradients of ligands in the target region Hornberger et al., 1999 . The coexpression of EphA5 and its ligands by primary olfactory neurons suggests a novel role for these molecules in the olfactory nerve pathway. The pioneer primary olfactory axons grow out over ensheathing cells that migrate from the nasal pit and form a bridge between the periphery and the telencephalon Cuschieri and Bannis-ter, 1975 . Later-growing axons then extend over the surface of the earlier axons and form fascicles that are subsequently encapsulated by ensheathing cells. Neither EphA5 nor its ligands are expressed in the olfactory nerve pathway at E12.5 when olfactory axons are first extending from the olfactory neuroepithelium toward the ventroros-tral telencephalon Treloar et al., 1996 . Thus, EphA5â ligand interactions do not appear to be involved in the initial wave of outgrowth of olfactory axons. However, from E13.5 onward, as EphA5 and its ligands are coexpressed by primary olfactory axons during the period of major axon growth, it is most likely that these molecules play an important role in the fascicular growth of olfactory axons. We have begun to study the role of EphA5 in the embryonic olfactory nerve pathway by modulating interac-tions between EphA5 and its ligands in explant cultures of olfactory neuroepithelium using 1 two independent poly-clonal antibodies against EphA5 2 a recombinant soluble form of EphA5 consisting of the extracellular domain of EphA5 and 3 a recombinant dimeric form of ephrin-A5 that activates EphA5. The antibodies against EphA5 significantly reduced neurite outgrowth by primary olfac- tory neurons when added to the culture medium at concen-trations as low as 30 Î¼g ml. Interestingly, these same antibodies had no effect on axon growth by cortical neu-rons, even at 200 Î¼g ml Winslow et al., 1995 . Reduced axon outgrowth was also observed when soluble EphA5-IgG was added to the olfactory neuroepithelial explants. This same recombinant protein had no effect on axon growth by cortical neurons Winslow et al., 1995 . Thus, blocking EphA5âligand interactions in olfactory neuroepi-thelial explant cultures reduced growth. These results indicate that EphA5âligand interactions are essential for normal olfactory axon elongation. We envisage a model whereby the expression and interaction of EphA5 and its ligands play a permissive role in axon growth in the olfactory nerve pathway. EphA5âligand interactions may mediate intraaxonal repulsion, which attenuates cell adhe-sion and hence facilitates axon growth Fig. 6A , in a similar way as previously described for polysialic acid on N-CAM Zhang et al, 1992 . Interestingly, olfactory ensheathing cells express the EphA5 receptor, whereas glial cells in other regions of the nervous system are known to express the Eph ligands but not the receptors. Although we have not examined the role of EphA5 in these cells, it is possible that signalling from ligands on the surface of the axons may play a role in the ensheathment of bundles of axons by the olfactory en-sheathing cells. In vivo, entire bundles of axons of primary olfactory neurons, rather than individual axons, are en-sheathed by olfactory ensheathing cells. Olfactory en-sheathing cells, which express EphA5, would be repelled from axons expressing EphA5 ligands. Thus, olfactory ensheathing cells would be inhibited from ensheathing individual axons and would preferentially ensheath entire bundles of olfactory axons Fig. 6A . During the early postnatal period in the olfactory bulb there was a noticeable change in the distribution of EphA5. There was a loss of EphA5 from primary olfactory axons, while at the same time this receptor began to be expressed by mitral cells, which is consistent with the previously reported distribution of its mRNA in mice Zhang et al., 1996 . In contrast, ligands continued to be expressed by primary olfactory axons throughout the postnatal period and into adulthood. Thus, there is a clear shift in the pattern of expression of EphA5 during the period when glomeruli are emerging in the outer layer of the olfactory bulb. During embryonic development, olfac-tory axons coexpressed both EphA5 receptors and their ligands, whereas postnatally these axons only expressed ligands for EphA5. Interestingly, some glomeruli had higher levels of ligands for EphA5 than other glomeruli, whereas expression of EphA5 in the postnatal animal was homogeneous across all glomeruli. Although the signifi-cance of this heterogeneous distribution of ligands is unclear, it is important to point out that other members of the EphA subclass of receptors can bind the ligands for EphA5 and that they could instead be differentially ex-pressed in glomeruli. At present, the identities of the ligands for EphA5 revealed by our EphA5-IgG binding analysis are unknown. A previous study revealed that in the adult mouse, ephrin-A3 was expressed by subpopula- tions of primary olfactory axons and glomeruli, whereas only low levels of ephrin-A5 were expressed in the olfac-tory system Zhang et al., 1996 . We postulate that EphA5âligand interactions could con-tribute to the establishment of the olfactory topographic map by modulating axon branching in the developing glomeruli. When primary olfactory axons enter the glo-merular layer of the olfactory bulb they defasciculate, and exhibit exuberant and aberrant growth Tenne-Brown and Key, 1999 . Axons branch and target more than one glomerulus during the early postnatal development before they finally terminate in a single glomerulus. Thus, the early postnatal loss of EphA5 on the primary olfactory axons may facilitate branching of these axons and the formation of arborisations in more than one glomerulus Fig. 6B . Interestingly, EphA5âephrinA interactions ap-pear to control branching and arborisation by both retinal Frise Â´n et al., 1998 and cortical axons Castellani et al., 1998 and within the hippocampus, ephrins and their receptors may even stimulate axonal arborisation and prune mistargeted axons Gao et al., 1999 . The differen-tial expression of ligands by primary olfactory axons and of EphA5 by mitral cells could lead to the subsequent refine-ment of axon terminals to a single glomerulus. It is possible that dendrites expressing high levels of EphA5 would form synapses with axons expressing low levels of ligand. Conversely, dendrites with low EphA5 may form synapses with axons expressing high levels of ligand Fig. The establishment of the olfactory topographic system is likely to require the combinations of a multitude of guid-ance molecules and the complex receptorâligand interac-tions mediated by EphA5 may provide some of this specific-ity. It is tempting to speculate that the response of cells to ligand binding by EphA5 may be sensitive to the type of ligand presented to the receptor, or it may be that the physiological response elicited by EphA5 activation is controlled by cell-specific intracellular signalling path-ways downstream of the receptor. It is most likely that cell responses cannot be predicted by examining a single Eph interaction, but they must be considered in the context of a complex combination of interactions of different Eph recep-tors and ligands as well as numerous other competing factors. In future studies, we will begin to analyse this complex set of signals mediating axon growth from the olfactory neuroepithelium. RESULTS EphA5 and its ligands are expressed in the developing olfactory nerve pathway To begin to understand the role of EphA5 in develop-ment of the olfactory nerve pathway, we immunostained tissue sections of the rat olfactory system with rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against the extracellular domain of EphA5 Winslow et al., 1995 or with commer-cially available antibodies against Hek7 that cross-react with rat EphA5 Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Because identical results were obtained with both polyclonal anti-bodies, data using the former antibodies only are pre-sented here. The distribution of ligands for EphA5 was determined by incubating tissue sections with soluble EphA5-IgG recombinant fusion protein followed by immu-nostaining for IgG. The EphA5-IgG fusion protein has a high-affinity binding interaction with ligands KD 5 1 nM and was used previously to localise ligands in the rat cortex Winslow et al., 1995 . The development of the rat olfactory system commences with the invagination of the olfactory placode at E11. At ,E12, the primary olfactory axons and neural cells emerge from the sensory neuroepithelium of the nasal pit and migrate to the rostroventral surface of the telencephalon, where they form an aggregate of tissue referred to as the migratory mass Doucette, 1989, 1993 Gong and Shipley, 1995 . No specific immunostaining for either EphA5 or its ligands was observed before E13.5 in the developing olfactory nerve pathway. These findings indicate that EphA5 and its ligands are not involved in the initial outgrowth of olfactory axons from the olfactory pit. At E13.5, EphA5 was diffusely distributed throughout the head mesenchyme and brain not shown . By E14.5, small bundles of olfactory axons and the migratory mass clearly stained more strongly than the surrounding mesenchymal tissue Fig. 1A . The EphA5 ligands were also present at low levels in the migratory mass at this age Fig. 1B . Between E14.5 and E18.5, the olfactory bulb evaginates from the telencephalon and the migratory mass fuses with its surface to form the olfactory nerve fibre layer Valverde et al., 1992 Treloar et al., 1996 . At E15.5, the olfactory axon bundles coursing between the olfactory neuroepithe-lium and the telencephalon continued to express both EphA5 Fig. 1C and its ligands Fig. 1D . Between E13.5 and E18.5, both EphA5 and its ligands were colocalised in the olfactory nerve and bulb, whereas after birth there was a clear shift in the cellular distribu-tions of these molecules. During late embryogenesis, EphA5 and its ligands were diffusely distributed throughout all layers of the olfactory bulb however, during the early postnatal period, when glomeruli become morphologically defined Tenne-Brown and Key, 1999 , these molecules become restricted to discrete bulbar lamina. By P1.5, the distribution of EphA5 was patchy with staining prominent in the mitral cell layer and within some glomeruli.At P5.5, EphA5 was clearly localised to mitral cells, their dendrites filled arrowheads, Fig. 1G , and glomeruli unfilled arrow-heads, Fig. 1G . In adults, not all mitral cells expressed equivalent amounts of EphA5 because there were obvious differences in the levels of EphA5 immunoreactivity among mitral cell perikarya arrows, Fig. 1I . Some tufted cells also expressed EphA5 in a zone immediately deep to the glomeruli in the adult olfactory bulb arrowhead, Fig. 1I . No specific immunostaining for EphA5 was detected in glomeruli in adult animals. Thus, the presence of EphA5 in glomeruli was transient and restricted to the early postnatal period. Expression in the glomeruli was prob-ably associated with the dendritic terminations of mitral cells and not axonal arborisations because we did not see any evidence of stained axons entering these structures from the nerve fibre layer. In contrast to the expression of EphA5 in the olfactory bulb, the ligands for this receptor were present in both the nerve fibre layer and in subpopu-lations of glomeruli throughout the early postnatal period and into maturity Fig. 1F, H, J . At P1.5, EphA5 ligands were uniformly expressed in the nerve fibre layer, whereas in the glomerular layer some glomeruli appeared to have higher levels of these ligands. The differential expression of EphA5 ligands became more apparent at P5.5 and continued into adulthood arrowheads, Fig. 1F, H, J . In the P5.5 olfactory bulb, some mitral cell perikarya began to express low levels of ligands arrows, Fig. 1H that persisted into adulthood large arrow, Fig. 1J . The results of the above analyses revealed that both EphA5 and its ligands were coexpressed in the olfactory nerve during embryogenesis. The olfactory nerve consists of bundles of unmyelinated axons that are enwrapped by olfactory ensheathing cells. To distinguish between axons and ensheathing cells, we immunostained sections from E18.5 embryos with antibodies against olfactory marker protein OMP, Fig. 2A for primary olfactory axons Keller and Margolis, 1975 and against p75 arrows, Fig. 2D for ensheathing cells Barnett et al., 1993 Ramo Â´n-Cueto et al., 1993 Gong et al., 1994 .Adjacent sections were reacted with anti-EphA5 antibodies Fig. 2B and with soluble EphA5-IgG fusion protein Fig. 2C . Expression patterns for EphA5 and its ligands coincided with immunostaining for OMP, indicating that these molecules were clearly present on axons in olfactory nerve bundles and nerve fibre layer. These results further suggested that EphA5 and its ligands were coexpressed by primary olfactory axons. Examination of the olfactory neuroepithelium revealed that the perikarya of primary olfactory neurons weakly expressed both EphA5 Fig. 2E and its ligands Fig. 2F . We were interested in assessing whether EphA5 and its ligands were expressed in vitro to begin a functional analysis of the role of these molecules in the olfactory nerve pathway. An in vitro explant culture system was developed that supported exuberant growth of primary olfactory axons. Sheets of olfactory neuroepithelium were dissected from E20.5 nasal septum, cut into small frag-ments, and plated onto an insert covered with Matrigel substrate. After 3 days in vitro, primary olfactory axons grew out over p75-expressing bipolar ensheathing cells that overlie a layer of flat fibroblastic cells K.T. Tisay and B. Key, unpublished observations . Immunostaining re-vealed that both the olfactory axon fascicles and bipolar ensheathing cells expressed EphA5 in vitro Figs. 3A, C . Staining of explant cultures with EphA5-IgG fusion pro-teins revealed that the primary olfactory axons and basal layer of fibroblastic cells expressed ligands for EphA5 but not the bipolar ensheathing cells Fig. 3B . Control cul-tures incubated with nonimmune serum or without the EphA5-IgG fusion protein Fig. 3D revealed negligible background staining. Therefore, expression of both EphA5 and its ligands on primary olfactory axons in vitro pro-vided us with a model to address the function of these molecules in this region of the nervous system. EphA5 plays a role in axon growth in the embryonic olfactory nerve pathway EphA5-ligand interactions were blocked by culturing explants of olfactory neuroepithelium in the presence of either anti-EphA5 antibodies 30â80 Î¼g ml , EphA5-IgG 30â90 Î¼g ml , or ephrin-A5-IgG 90 Î¼g ml . Treating ex-plant cultures of olfactory neuroepithelium with antibod-ies against EphA5 clearly perturbed the extent of axon outgrowth without obviously affecting axon fasciculation. The level of axon outgrowth from explants was quantified by two methods first, by measuring the area of axon bundles in digitised images, and second, by counting the number of axon bundles, at 100-Î¼m annular intervals that extended from the edge of the explant. Explants grown in control media or in media containing normal rabbit serum had the greatest axon outgrowth Figs. 4A and 5A, B . In contrast, explants grown in 30 Î¼g ml anti-EphA5 IgG Figs. 4B and 5A had significantly reduced axon out-growth P , 0.01 . Higher concentrations of anti-EphA5 60 and 80 Î¼g ml further reduced axon growth P , 0.001 Figs. 4C, D and 5A . In addition to the reduction in total area of axon outgrowth, the number of axon bundles was also reduced in a concentration-dependent manner Fig. 5C . A similar concentration-dependent reduction in axon outgrowth was also observed when explants were grown in the presence of polyclonal rabbit IgG against Hek7 not shown Santa Cruz Biotechnology , which confirmed the specificity of response. These antibodies are unlikely to be toxic to neurons, because previous studies revealed that they had no effect on cell survival or neurite outgrowth by cortical neurons in vitro Winslow et al., 1995 . However, because bivalent blocking antibodies were used in these experiments, it was possible that they induced clustering of EphA5 on the surface of the olfactory axons, which could have affected axon growth. This possibility was ruled out because control cultures incubated with anti-EphA5 IgG for 2 hours and then fixed and immunostained for EphA5 revealed no clustering of EphA5 on axons not shown . An alternative interpretation of the above results is that the anti-EphA5 antibodies directly activated the EphA5 receptor instead of blocking ligand-mediated activation. We addressed this possibility by culturing explants in the presence of EphA5-IgG fusion protein. This soluble recom-binant receptor acts as an antagonist of endogenous receptorâligand interactions and effectively blocks ligand-mediated activation Meima et al., 1997 . EphA5-IgG significantly reduced axon outgrowth, with the highest concentration causing the greatest reduction as assessed by axon area Fig. 5A . Thus, axon growth was reduced when EphAâligand interactions were blocked with either excess soluble receptor or with antibodies against the receptor. These results support a role for EphA5 in facilitat-ing axon elongation in the olfactory nerve pathway rather than retarding it as reported in other regions of the nervous system Friedman and OâLeary, 1996 . To confirm that activation of EphA5 does not have a chemoinhibitory effect on olfactory axon growth, we next cultured explants in the presence of soluble recombinant ephrin-A5-IgG fusion protein. This dimeric form of recombinant eph-rin-A5 binds to and activates EphA5 as effectively as membrane-bound endogenous EphA5 Meima et al., 1997 . We used the same recombinant ephrin-A5-IgG fusion protein that previously caused collapse of growth cones and growth retardation of cortical axons Meima et al., 1997 . Axon outgrowth in our olfactory neuroepithelial cultures in the presence of ephrin-A5-IgG 90 Î¼g ml was slightly longer but not significantly different from controls Fig. 5B . This lack of effect by ephrin-A5-IgG confirms that EphA5 and or other EphA receptors do not inhibit growth in the embryonic olfactory nerve pathway. More-over, this result is a fortuitous control since it indicates that the reduced axon outgrowth observed with the recom-binant EphA5-IgG described above was not a nonspecific toxic effect of our recombinant proteins.

Neurol. 416 213â223, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Retinal ganglion cell axons can be induced to grow into and form synapses in certain nonoptic structures during optic nerve regeneration. This result has suggested that molecular mechanisms involved in attracting and stabiliz-ing retinal fiber projections are present or can be ex-pressed in parts of the central nervous system CNS outside of the normal optic pathway. One of the more thoroughly characterized examples of such an aberrant connection is the formation of a terminal field selectively in the frog olfactory cortex, which occurs when the optic nerve is severed from the optic chiasma and implanted into the caudal basal telencephalon Scalia, 1987, 1992 . The projection forms in the presence of an intact olfactory bulb and tract. More recent studies Scalia et al., 1995, 1997a have shown that this projection is much more stable than originally suggested, and may be permanent. The ability to induce this aberrant projection in adult Rana pipiens was viewed as an opportunity to study the mapping behavior of retinal fibers in an area presumably lacking the appropriate topographic markers. The organi-zation achieved by retinal fibers in a foreign area might reveal properties built upon or masked when interacting normally with the tectum and other normal optic nuclei. Subsequent electrophysiological recording and anatomical tracing studies Scalia et al., 1995, 1997a revealed that the bulk of the projection is established by the temporal retina, whereas the terminals of nasal retinal axons are confined to a narrow strip along the anterior edge of the projection field. When the retinal ganglion cells involved in this projection were labeled by means of retrograde trans-port, the preponderance of labeled neurons was found on the temporal side of the optic disc.1 Beyond this level of organization, there was no further topographic order. The partial projections of nasal and temporal retinal fibers to more or less separate but adjacent subfields lacking any internal topological order suggested to us that the overall projection had been established by factors addressing the retina as two differentially identifiable hemiretinal blocks or compartments Scalia et al., 1997 . On the assumption that the molecules controlling this abnormal retinal projection have a more general biological significance, we presented the topography of the aberrant retinotelencephalic projection as evidence of the probable existence of compartment mapping factors in the tectum as well. To support this argument further, we noted that the temporal fiber-repellent molecules in posterior tectal membrane for reviewed see OâLeary et al., 1999 appear insensitive to the level of origin of the fiber along the horizontal axis and could, therefore, only be expected in vivo to be capable of restricting temporal fiber endings to the anterior half of the tectum as an unsorted block. A recent study using the striped membrane model has led to a similar conclusion Rosentreter et al., 1998 . The earlier findings suggested further that the agents responsible for establishing the anomalous projection to olfactory cortex may be positively biased toward the tempo-ral retina. This bias could mean that attractants or trophic agents may exist or be inducible both in the tectum and in the olfactory cortex that are addressed selectively to temporal retinal fibers. Evidence that nasal fiber-specific attractants may exist in the tectum during the develop-ment of the retinotectal projection has been presented in studies demonstrating that nasal retinal fibers mistarget to anterior tectal sites overexpressing the engrailed homo-logues en-1 or en-2 Friedman and OâLeary, 1996 Itasaki and Nakamura, 1996 , whose expression is usually con-fined to the posterior end of the tectum Itasaki and Nakamura, 1992 . Therefore, the underrepresentation of the nasal retina in the anomalous projection might be accounted for by an absence of the specific nasal fiber attractants controlled by the en genes. By the same logic, however, the presence of a substantial representation of temporal fibers in the foreign target would lend weight to the probable existence of temporal fiber-specific attractants, and, if such agents are present in foreign targets, it seems likely, as noted above, that they would also exist in the tectum. However, no molecule with attractant or trophic activity specific to temporal retinal fibers has yet been identified. The only guidance molecules known to have an effect on the targeting of temporal retinal fibers, i.e., RGM Stahl et al., 1990 and the Eph receptor ligands ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5, appear to be repellents Walter et al., 1990 Cheng et al., 1995 Drescher et al., 1995 Nakamoto et al., 1996 . The likely absence of ephrin-A2 ephrin-A5 expression in the foreign target could permit the temporal retinal fibers to spread their arbors throughout the neuropil, but the question would remain, are the temporal and nasal retinal fibers differentially attracted to and or supported by the foreign target? When the winged helix transcription factors CBF-1 and CBF-2, which are normally expressed in the nasal and temporal retina, respectively, are misexpressed in the opposite halves of the retina during development, fibers from each half of the retina form terminal arbors in the wrong half of the tectum Yuasa et al., 1996 . This effect would be expected if CBF-1 and CBF-2 control attraction-mediating receptors specific to the nasal and temporal retina, al-though the interpretation actually given proposed that CBF-2 may up-regulate and CBF-1 down-regulate recep-tors activated by the repellent ligands. One approach to examining this question further would be to study the representation of the retina in other examples of anomalous retinal projections. Anomalous retinal projections form in the thalamus of neonatal mam-mals following various schedules of brain lesions Frost, 1981 . In particular, retinal fibers form a terminal field in the lateral posterior nucleus LP after ablation of the superior colliculus Schneider, 1973 Baisinger et al., 1977 . The anomalous projection to LP has been shown in the hamster to have elements of a crude retinotopic order, with a strong asymmetry in which it is the ventral retina that is heavily overrepresented Frost, 1981 .An analogous projec-tion has been described in nonmammalian vertebrates. In adult fish and amphibians, a retinal projection forms in the ipsilateral dorsal thalamus when the optic fibers entering the midbrain tectum are severed and the tectal hemisphere of that side is ablated Sharma, 1973, 1981 Kicliter et al., 1974 Cantore and Scalia, 1987 . The cell group in which the novel projection appears is normally the main recipient of the ascending tectothalamic projec-tion Rubinson, 1968 Lazar, 1969 Masino and Grobstein, 1990 Montgomery and Fite, 1991 . This structure, which in the frog is a complex formed by the central, anterolat-eral, and posteroventrolateral C AL PVL nuclei Neary and Northcutt, 1983 , does not receive a retinal projection during optic nerve regeneration in the presence of intact tecta, nor at any time during development Stelzner et al., 1981 Hoskins and Grobstein, 1985 . The normal tectal projection to the lateral neuropil of C AL PVL is not topographically organized and, therefore, presumably not retinotopically labeled Montgomery and Fite, 1991 . The present study examines the topographic organiza-tion of this anomalous retinothalamic projection in Rana pipiens. The results establish a second example in which temporal retinal fibers appear to develop an augmented role relative to nasal fibers in the innervation of a foreign area. This result further supports the likelihood that positive, target-based factors contribute to the differential projections of temporal and nasal retinal fibers. However, insofar as prey insects that are successfully captured and swallowed are usually imaged in the binocular field imme-diately preceding the attack, the firing patterns of tempo-ral and nasal retinal fibers in the aberrant projection are not equally correlated with feeding activity. The possibility that the closer correlation of temporal fiber activity with food intake may lead to stabilization of the temporal in preference to the nasal fiber terminals must, therefore, be considered as an alternative or supplementary explana-tion for the asymmetry of the aberrant projections. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is based on a series of 15 adult frogs Rana pipiens, 3â3.5 in. body length surviving surgical ablation of the right tectal hemisphere. Surgery was performed with methane tricane sulfonate MS-222 anesthesia 0.2 mg g sc . A skin flap was made over the midbrain, the cranium was opened with a dental burr, the meninges were incised, and the tectal plate was removed unilater-ally by aspiration. Care was taken to avoid damaging the pretectal region and underlying torus semicircularis. The cranial wound was closed with a square of millipore filter, the skin was sutured, and the frog was returned to its holding pen. The frogs were maintained in an aquarium provided with running water and floating platforms and were fed crickets. They usually resumed feeding the day after operation. All procedures followed appropriate insti-tutional animal care guidelines. Sampling was begun at 13 weeks survival and continued through 46 weeks see Table 1 . The partial projections from defined regions of the left retina were studied by application of biotinylated dextran amine BDA to retinal axons severed intraocularly. As described in more detail elsewhere Scalia et al., 1997b , the sclera was surgically exposed over a quadrant of the retina with the frog under MS-222 anesthesia and punctured with a curved stylus. The stylus was drawn across the vitreal surface of the retina to cut retinal axons derived from a particular sector. The stylus was withdrawn, and the eye was injected with 4â5 Î¼l of frog Ringerâs containing 10â20% BDA Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR 3,000 mw , 20Î¼Ci L-proline 5-3H 25â36 Ci mmol Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL , and 20Î¼Ci L-leucine 4,5-3H 47 Ci mmol Amersham . This was done to map the projection of the cut axons derived from a truncated sector of the retina against a background pro-vided by the transport of the tritium label in the intact axons derived from the remainder of the retina. Three or four days later, the frog was reanesthetized and killed by transcardial perfusion with Ringerâs, followed by 4% glutar-aldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The brains and eyes were dissected out and saved. The brains were cryoprotected by equilibration with 30% buffered sucrose and sectioned frozen at 50 Î¼m in the horizontal plane. Two alternating series of sections were collected. One set was reacted freely floating for BDA, mounted on glass slides, dehydrated, cleared, and covered. The other set was mounted and processed by autoradiogra-phy. The procedures for BDA histochemistry and autoradi-ography were described previously Scalia et al., 1997b . Additional material from previous studies on the normal optic projections and the aberrant retinothalamic projec-tion was also available for examination. DISCUSSION The results of this study indicate that the aberrant retinothalamic projection established in the adult frog after tectal ablation is formed mainly by fibers from the temporal retina. In the experimental animals surviving for more than 16 weeks postoperatively in which placements of tracer BDA were made in the nerve fiber layer of the dorsotemporal or ventrotemporal quadrants of the retina, the tracer labeled densely a large fraction of the aberrant field, occupying nearly its complete outline. Placements of tracer in the nasal half of the retina revealed weaker projections formed by smaller populations of fibers at all survival times, although the same placements labeled substantial projections in the lateral geniculate complex and pretectum. A notable outcome of the present study is the similarity revealed in the organization of the anomalous projections of retinal fibers to two anatomically unrelated brain areas, the olfactory cortex and lateral neuropil. This similarity suggests certain inferences that would be less compelling had the projections to either of the nonoptic targets been shown to arise equally from both halves of the retina or to arise mainly from the nasal retina. The common asymme-try of the projections immediately suggests two hypoth-eses 1 Specific chemoattractant or trophic factors exist that are selectively targeted to temporal retinal fibers. 2 Reinforcing stimuli, as may occur during successful at-tacks on prey insects, stabilize the misplaced temporal fiber terminals in preference to the nasal fiber terminals. However, before discussing these possible determinants, the extent to which the present results might have been influenced by incidental neuroanatomical relationships and other nonspecific variables should be considered. Nonspecific determinants First, it is possible that some aspects of the organization of the aberrant retinothalamic projection are influenced by the topographic geometry of the normal optic tract. For example, although the subfields labeled by dorsal and ventral placements of tracer in the temporal retina were broadly overlapping, an indication of poor retinotopic differentiation, the overlap was not absolute. Fibers origi-nating in the dorsal or ventral parts of the temporal retina tended not to reach into, respectively, the ventral and dorsal poles of the aberrant field. This might reflect only a failure of tectal ablation to disturb the normal organiza-tion of the optic tract. That is to say, because fibers from the ventral retina normally run in the dorsal half of the optic tract, whereas fibers from the dorsal retina run in its ventral half Fujisawa et al., 1981 , the persistence of this arrangement may tend to focus the regenerating fiber terminals from the dorsal and ventral halves of the retina into regions of the lateral neuropil more proximate to the location of their parent axons in the optic tract. However, this would not explain the final distribution of temporal and nasal fiber terminals. Nasal retinal fibers normally course within both the dorsal and the ventral margins of the optic tract in the diencephalon, whereas the temporal fibers occupy the middle stream Fujisawa et al., 1981 . If the normal fiber topography had determined the distribu-tion of temporal and nasal fiber terminals, the nasal terminals would have accumulated in the dorsal and ventral poles of the lateral neuropil, and the temporal fiber terminals would have concentrated at midlevel. However, this was not observed. Second, it seems reasonable to assume that possible topographic markers in the foreign targets may interact with the misplaced retinal fibers. Although the olfactory cortex does not normally receive a retinal projection, the lateral neuropil does have second-order retinally derived input by way of the tectum. However, this projection, which arises from all regions of the ipsilateral tectum, is not tectotopically organized Montgomery and Fite, 1991 . Therefore, the lateral neuropil does not appear to contain at the outset any vestige of a retinotopic map with which to influence the organization of the novel projection. Third, the format of the retinal projection in areas adjacent to the lateral neuropil is also not likely to have influenced the organization of the aberrant terminal field. One might suppose, for example, that the new terminals might become arranged in a pattern consistent with the mapping of the retinal terminals in the established contigu-ous areas of the thalamus and pretectum. However, al-though the lateral neuropil is bordered anteriorly by a temporal retinal projection field in the nucleus of Bellonci and corpus geniculatum, it is also bordered posteriorly by a nasal projection field in the posterior thalamic nucleus Montgomery and Fite, 1989 . Because the temporal reti-nal component of the aberrant projection extends the full anteroposterior width of the lateral neuropil, it becomes contiguous with the nasal projection field in the posterior thalamic nucleus. Finally, the possible influence of plastic regenerative responses in other fiber systems damaged during ablation of the tectum might warrant consideration. In particular, fibers from the contralateral nucleus isthmi are transected along the anterior border of the tectum at the time of surgery. These fibers might recover and innervate the lateral neuropil along with the injured retinal fibers. Because the contralateral nucleus isthmi represents the temporal retina Gruberg and Udin, 1978 Gruberg and Lettvin, 1980 Grobstein and Comer, 1983 , such rerouting of the isthmal fibers could in some way influence the organization of the retinal projection. However, although the ability of injured isthmotectal fibers to regenerate has never been studied, it has been shown that tectal axons do not regenerate in the frog Lyon and Stelzner, 1987 . This suggests that, with the exception of the optic nerve, frog CNS axons have only a limited capacity to regenerate. Molecular specificity If attractant or trophic factors are responsible for the formation, and particularly for the asymmetry, of the experimentally induced aberrant projections, it seems reasonable to infer that such agents would have a natural function in the normal targets of the retinal projection. However, with respect to the development of the retinotec-tal system, there is little agreement on whether any aspect of the organization of the retinal map, or even the target-ing of the tectum per se, is controlled by specific attractant trophic factors. Evidence has been presented against the existence of long-range chemical attractants Harris et al., 1985 McFarlane et al., 1995 , while others have given theoretical arguments suggesting the need for target-based, short-range chemoattractants to provide a positive factor in the innervation of the tectum Taylor, 1990 OâLeary et al., 1999 . In one model OâLeary et al., 1999 , a gradient of a receptor on retinal fibers, running from high in the most temporal fibers to low in the most nasal fibers, is matched with a ligand in the tectum, graded from low anteriorly to high posteriorly. An attractant function, expressed as the induction of interstitial branching behind anterior to the growth cone of the advancing fiber, is activated at all points at which a threshold value in the product of receptor and ligand concentration is exceeded. This would establish along the anteroposterior axis of the tectum a critical coordinate for each fiber at which its most anterior branches could appear. A parallel gradient of repellent activity would inhibit branching in the region posterior to the critical coordinate so that synaptic terminals that result from the branching would be confined to the critical region. The model does not invoke different attractant systems for temporal and nasal retinal fibers, only one system acti-vated over a spatial gradient. To explain the asymmetry noted in the anomalous projections in terms of this model, it would only be necessary to assume that the foreign targets express the attraction-activating ligand only at a single concentration throughout the neuropil. That concen-tration would determine how much of the temporonasal axis could be effectively represented, because it would be sufficient to promote the branching of all axons from the temporal side meeting or exceeding a critical level of receptor, but not enough to activate the more nasal popula-tion. Alternatively, the attractants involved in the targeting of temporal and nasal retinal fibers may belong to separate molecular systems. This possibility is supported by several lines of evidence indicating that nasal fibers have a specific affinity for posterior tectum that is mediated by a mecha-nism not shared with temporal fibers. First, it has been reported that nasal fibers growing in vitro have a tendency to prefer and to survive longer on substrates containing posterior tectal membrane components, whereas temporal fibers are repelled by posterior membrane and survive better on anterior membrane Boxberg et al., 1993 . The repellent effect is believed to be activated by the Eph receptor ligands ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5, which are expressed at high levels in the posterior tectum of many species. These members of the ephrin family appear to be regulated by en-1 and en-2, homologues of Drosophila engrailed Itasaki and Nakamura, 1992 Shigetani et al., 1997 . Experimental misexpression of the en genes in the anterior tectum during the development of the retinotectal projection disrupts the targeting of both nasal and tempo-ral fibers. Temporal retinal fibers tend to stall in the optic tract at the anterior border of the tectum, whereas nasal fibers tend to branch ectopically in the anterior tectum, sometimes forming terminal arbors in areas of high en misexpression Friedman and OâLeary, 1996 Itasaki and Nakamura, 1996 . Thus, the en gene appears to mediate contrasting effects of attraction in nasal fibers and repul-sion in temporal fibers. It is not known whether these effects are graded along the temporonasal axis of the retina or expressed as a step function. Either way, the reversal evidently occurs somewhere near the middle of the retina, and, insofar as the functional consequence is to create an attractant specific for nasal fibers, it seems reasonable to suggest that a separate system is needed to activate attraction specific to temporal fibers. In any event, the hypothesis that retinal fiber-specific factors are involved in establishing the aberrant projec-tions raises the question of why such factors would be expressed in nonoptic areas of the brain. One possibility is that these agents are induced by the presence of retinal fiber endings, an idea proposed earlier in a more general model of the retinotectal projection Wilshaw and van der Malsburg, 1979 . The induction process may take place over a protracted period the abnormal projections appear to develop gradually over several months postoperatively. However, the protracted amplification of the temporal fiber projection may also reflect the gradually realized impact of behaviorally relevant events on the morphology of the retinal terminals, as discussed below. Behavioral reinforcement It is possible that the asymmetric organization of both aberrant projections is consolidated, or even driven, by a process of activity experience-dependent plasticity associ-ated with feeding behavior after the misplaced terminals become functionally integrated into the normal synaptic networks of the telencephalon and lateral thalamus. The retinal terminals in the olfactory cortex may be con-scripted into assuming some of the roles of the normal olfactory tract terminals whose territory they have in-vaded. Visually evoked activity may then supplement true odorant-elicited signals during olfactory learning. Simi-larly, retinal terminals in the lateral neuropil may take on the role of the tectal endings they have replaced, which may involve them in processes normally related to, for example, the learning of environmental cues important for effective prey capture. In their new roles, the retinal terminals may undergo morphological changes appropri-ate to the long-term storage of associations between visual signals and feeding. However, the terminals would provide signals meaningfully correlated with the capture of prey insects only when the prey has been imaged in the binocular field, as described below. The frogâs total visual field consists of lateral subfields that are monocular and a frontal binocular subfield Fite, 1973 . Careful study of prey-catching behavior in R. pipi-ens Ingle, 1970 has revealed that the prey insect is almost always captured by means of a direct frontal attack. In other words, the frog does not usually flick its tongue to the side to capture prey in the lateral visual field but turns bodily to face the victim prior to or at the time of capture. This maneuver places the prey in the frontal binocular field, if only momentarily. Thus, when a prey insect is detected in the lateral field of the normal eye, which is imaged on the nasal retina, the frog may turn toward it to view it in the frontal field. This orienting response repositions the image onto the temporal retina of both eyes. Because the normal eye remains connected to the contralateral tectum the entire retina projects contra-laterally to the tectum , the frog may lunge forward in the normal way and capture the insect the snapping re-sponse . At the same time, the temporal fiber terminals in the aberrant projection will also be active, although prob-ably without behavioral consequence. If, as a result of prey capture a reward-associated fiber system is activated, the normal function of which would be to potentiate the recently active synapses of exteroceptive systems firing in temporal correlation with feeding, the long-term effect of the repeated food reinforcement may lead to stabilization and proliferation of the temporal in preference to the nasal fiber terminals of the aberrant projection. On the other hand, when a prey insect moves in the lateral field of the abnormal eye, there is either no behavioral response or an inappropriate one, in which the frog orients toward the mirror-symmetric locus in the opposite lateral field. Mirror-symmetric orienting occurs as a result of the recrossed innervation of the intact tectum, as observed previously Misantone and Stelzner, 1974 . In either case, there would be no reward associated with this activity. The nasal fiber terminals of the abnormally connected eye that are located in the foreign target olfactory cortex or lateral neuropil would be less frequently reinforced than the temporal fiber endings and may ultimately be retracted. Many studies have presented evidence that changes in various aspects of synaptic structure can accompany learn-ing and memory formation for review see Bailey and Kandel, 1993 , but only a few have provided information on the effects of learning on the size of the terminal arbor. It is known that the number of varicosities and terminal branches of identified sensory nerve terminals in Aplysia increase after long-term sensitization of gill withdrawal and decrease with its habituation Bailey and Chen, 1988 . Although such correlations might appear to provide sup-portive evidence, an important difference between the model studied in Aplysia and the proposal discussed above is that sensitization and habituation are considered to be forms of nonassociative learning Bailey and Kandel, 1993 , but the hypothetical process condidered here is associative. In contrast to the findings in Aplysia, a reduction in arbor size was observed in a study of associa-tive learning in Hermissenda Alkon et al., 1990 . Thus, appropriate evidence to support the above proposal is not presently available. In any event, the possible contribution of behavioral reinforcement may be tested by reexamining the topographic organization of the aberrant retinotha-lamic and retinotelencephalic projections formed under conditions that eliminate binocular imaging during prey capture. RESULTS Figure 1 is provided to illustrate the form and location of the aberrant retinothalamic projection in relation to the normal retinal projection to the contralateral diencepha-lon. The abnormal projection Fig. 1A,C,E lies just deep to the optic tract and occupies the external half or more of the superficial neuropil of the C AV PVL complex. This lateral thalamic neuropil is interposed between the neuropil of the lateral geniculate complex âânucleusââ of Bellonci and ââcorpusââ geniculatum thalamicum anteriorly and the pos-terior thalamic âânucleusââof the pretectum posteriorly, each of which receives a dense, retinotopically organized projec-tion from the retina both in the normal Fig. 1B,D,F and in the experimental frog. In the normal frog, the lateral neuropil does not contain any part of the retinal projection Fig. 1B,D,F , although some fascicles of retinal axons pass through the field on the way to the pretectum and tectum Cantore and Scalia, 1987 . Projections from the temporal retina The density of the partial projections contributing to the aberrant field varied according to the location of the tracer placements and the survival time. The strongest projec-tions were obtained from placements in the temporal retina in frogs surviving 36 or more weeks postoperatively Nos. 11, 12, and 14 . In contrast, the projections observed in Nos. 3 and 4, which survived only 13 and 16 weeks, was much less dense, giving the impression that the temporal fiber projection had not yet fully formed. Among the stronger projections, a typical pattern is illustrated in Figure 2A, in a case having a ventrotemporal retinal incision No. 12 .As expected, the BDAlabel in the nucleus neuropil of Bellonci is confined to its posterior rim at this horizontal level, and the label in the posterior thalamic nucleus neuropil of the pretectum is also confined to the posterior half of the profile. This pattern is consistent with earlier descriptions of the organization of the retinal projections to the lateral geniculate complex and pretec-tum Muntz, 1962 Lazar, 1971 Scalia and Fite, 1974 Montgomery and Fite, 1989 . Correspondingly, the autora-diographic silver Fig. 2B is prominent anteriorly in both structures, and clear defects appear in the positions occu-pied by the BDA-labeled field components. In contrast with this retinotopically differentiated pattern, the BDA label is distributed evenly along the anteroposterior dimen-sion of the lateral neuropil of C AV PVL, but there is no defect present in the autoradiogram. As illustrated at a series of horizontal levels in Figure 3AâE, the lateral neuropil in this animal No. 12 contained a smooth distribution of label along most of its dorsoventral extent A is most dorsal . However, the label became attenuted toward the ventral end of the neuropil. This pole is strongly labeled in the adjacent autoradiograms not shown . Similar results were observed in a case No. 11 showing the projection from the dorsotemporal quadrant of the retina Fig. 3FâJ . The projection in the lateral geniculate complex and pretectum was organized in the expected pattern. The BDA and autoradiographic labeling in the lateral neuropil were exactly coextensive and showed no preferential distribution along the anteroposterior di-mension. In this case, however, the BDA label became attenuated toward the dorsal end of the neuropil, which was strongly labeled in the adjacent autoradiograms. Taken together, the two cases illustrated demonstrate some degree of topographic differentiation along the dorso-ventral axis of the lateral neuropil in the sense that axons from the ventral part of the temporal retina, which nor-mally run in the dorsal half of the optic tract, fail to reach the ventralmost end of the lateral neuropil. Similarly, fibers from the dorsal part of the temporal retina, which normally run in the ventral half of the optic tract, fail to reach the dorsal pole of the lateral neuropil. In contrast, there is little or no differentiation in the anteroposterior dimension the temporal retinal axons in either case are spread uniformly across this axis and also throughout the thickness of the lateral neuropil. Projections from the ventral retina In four other cases Nos. 5, 6, 13, and 15 , the retinal incision was placed ventrally across a vertical meridian passing through the optic disc. In three of these frogs Nos. 5, 6, and 15 , the BDA-labeled component of the projection to the lateral geniculate complex and posterior thalamic nucleus was, as reported in earlier studies, confined to their most dorsal poles on the contralateral side of the brain, and there was a significant ipsilateral thalamic component to this projection see, e.g., Scalia and Fite, 1974 . There was no projection to the lateral neuropil in the BDA-labeled sections, although the adjacent autoradio-grams confirmed the presence of a fully developed aber-rant projection. In the fourth frog No. 13 , the retinal incision was much longer than in the others and extended both nasally and temporally almost to the level of the horizontal meridian. The BDA label in this case filled the entire profile of the lateral neuropil across its anteroposte-rior and dorsoventral dimensions. The results in these cases suggest that very little of the aberrant projection originates near the ventral pole of the retina. Projections from the nasal retina In five cases, the retinal incision was placed on the nasal side of the optic disc. The partial projections to the lateral geniculate and pretectal complexes was typically well developed and retinotopically organized in each case Fig. 4 . Fibers arising in the nasal retina terminated anteriorly in the nucleus of Bellonci and corpus geniculatum thalami-cum, anterior to the lateral neuropil, and also in the anterior part of the posterior thalamic nucleus, posterior to the lateral neuropil. In contrast, the projections to the lateral neuropil were consistently weak. In each case, the BDA-labeled fiber plexuses were loosely composed, but extended along most of the dorsoventral axis of the lateral neuropil. Near the ventral pole, the BDA-labeled fibers occupied the deeper region of the neuropil and seemed to extend anteriorly from the labeled fiber system entering the pretectum. In the middle and dorsal end of the lateral neuropil, the fibers tended to shift more superficially and posteriorly to maintain contiguity with the field of label in the pretectum. In the three cases Nos. 8â10 studied at 31â33 weeks see Fig. 4A,C , the contribution of the nasal sectors to the aberrant field was virtually nonexistent com-pared to the somewhat greater projection in the two cases Nos.1and2 examinedat13weekssurvival asinFig.4B .In these two frogs, the density of the projection from the nasal retina was comparable to that of the temporal retina when observed at the shorter survival times. These changes in the density of the partial projections may mean that such projec-tion fields as are formed initially by the nasal retinal fibers are not maintained over the longer survival periods, while the temporal fiber projection becomes increasingly amplified. Projections from the dorsal retina Four cases had incisions placed on the dorsal side of the retina Nos. 7, 10, 11, and 14 . In one case No. 7 , the incision included tissue on both sides of the vertical meridian. The projections to the lateral geniculate com-plex and pretectum in this case were localized toward their ventral ends, and, as expected, there was a small ipsilat-eral projection owing to involvement of the temporal retina. The projection to the lateral neuropil was well developed but was most concentrated near its ventral pole. In the remaining three cases, the incision, although dorsal, was confined to either the nasal or the temporal side of the vertical meridian. Case No. 10 is illustrated in Figure 4C, and case No. 11 is illustrated in Figure 3FâJ. In case No. 14, the incision was confined to a small area in the dorsotemporal retina very close to the vertical meridian. The appropriate pattern of contralateral and ipsilateral projection was found in the lateral geniculate complex and pretectum, and the BDA-labeled projection to the lateral neuropil was densely matted and spread throughout its extent. These results indicate that the contribution of the dorsal retina to the anomalous innervation arises mainly from the temporal side of the vertical meridian. Recrossed innervation of the intact tectum With prolonged survival times, increasing numbers of retinal fibers grow across the midline through available tissue bridges and innervate the intact tectum Kicliter et al., 1974 Misantone et al., 1974 . The size of the recrossed population was examined qualitatively in relation to the placement of the retinal incisions, to determine whether differences in the strength of innervation of the lateral thalamic neuropil might be inversely correlated with the size of the recrossed populations. There was no evidence in the BDA-labeled sections that nasal retinal fibers had recrossed in greater numbers than the temporal fibers at any survival time. This is further borne out in the autora-diographs of frogs 5, 6, and 15, all of which had ventral incisions sparing most of the temporal and nasal retina. In these cases, the relative density of autoradiographic silver marking the projections from intact temporal and nasal axons was approximately equivalent in the anterior and posterior regions of the intact tectum.

Neurol. 416 201â212, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Precise development of neuronal connectivity is not rigidly predetermined and ââhard-wiredââ but is profoundly influenced by the environment Frost and Metin, 1985 Sur et al., 1988 OâLeary and Stanfield, 1989 Schlaggar and OâLeary, 1991 . As an axon grows toward its target during development, its growth cone senses molecules within the environment that it uses to determine the correct path of growth Garrity and Zipursky, 1995 . These molecular cues may be soluble and freely diffusing, bound to cellular membranes, or bound to the extracellular environment. Along their way axons use intermediate ââguidepostsââ to find the final target Tessier-Lavigne et al., 1988 . Thus, axons may follow gradients of molecules released by the target itself or the intermediate guideposts. Such mol-ecules may deliver attractive Placzek et al., 1990 , repul-sive Pini, 1993 Luo et al., 1993 , or suppressive Wang et al., 1996 cues to the growth cone. Some molecules can act as either attractive or repulsive cues for axons Hedgecock et al., 1990 depending on the expression of separate receptors for attraction or repulsion in the responding cells Chan et al., 1996 . The guidance molecule Netrin-1 can mediate both attraction and repul-sion. Netrin-1 was first purified by its ability to attract sensory commissural neurons in the spinal cord Serafini et al., 1994 , but it also repels motor axons Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995 Varela-Echavarria et al., 1997 . The Netrins belong to a phylogenetically conserved family of long-range guidance molecules with activities in C. elegans UNC-6 Ishii et al., 1992 , Drosophila Netrin-A and Netrin-B Harris et al., 1996 Mitchell et al., 1996 , and vertebrates Kennedy et al., 1994 Serafini et al., 1994 Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995 Shirasaki et al., 1996 Richards et al., 1997 Varela-Echavarria et al., 1997 . Netrin-1 is either repulsive or attractive for axons depending on the neuronal population. This bifunctional-ity correlates with the activity of the C. elegans homologue of Netrin-1, Unc-6, which has also been shown to mediate both attractive and repulsive responses Hedgecock et al., 1990 . Unc-6 is required for the dorsal migration of meso-dermal cells and for the guidance of circumferential axons Hedgecock et al., 1990 . Two known receptors for Unc-6 are Unc-40 and Unc-5. Genetic experiments have shown that axons are attracted to Unc-6 if they express the Unc-40 receptor but are repelled from Unc-6 if they express the Unc-5 receptor. The mammalian homologues of Unc-40 and Unc-5 have now been cloned. Neogenin Vielmetter et al., 1994 and deleted in colorectal carci-noma DCC Keino-Masu et al., 1996 are homologous to C. elegans Unc-40, and Unc-5H1, Unc-5H2 Leonardo et al., 1997 and rostral cerebellar malformation rcm Ackerman et al., 1997 are homologous to C. elegans Unc-5 Lenug-Hagesteijn et al., 1992 . DCC is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules Walsh and Doherty, 1997 and has been shown to bind Netrin-1 in vitro Keino-Masu et al., 1996 . DCC was originally cloned as a tumor supressor gene in colorectal carcinomas Fearon et al., 1990 . In the developing ner-vous system, DCC has been evolutionarily conserved with homologues cloned in Drosophila Kolodziej et al., 1996 , C. elegans Chan et al., 1996 , Xenopus Pierceall et al., 1994 , rodents Cooper et al., 1995 Keino-Masu et al., 1996 , and humans Fearon et al., 1990 Nigro et al., 1991 . In the mammalian brain, Netrin-1 mutants and DCC knockout mice do not develop a corpus callosum or a hippocampal commissure and have a greatly reduced or absent anterior commissure Serafini et al., 1996 Fazeli et al., 1997 . However, the mechanism for these pathfinding defects in the brain is not known. In the developing forebrain, Netrin-1 has been shown to attract laterally directed cortical axons in vitro Metin et al., 1997 Rich-ards et al., 1997 , indicating that these molecules are important for additional axonal guidance systems in the forebrain other than commissural axon guidance. Al-though there has been some expression analysis of DCC and Netrin mRNA in the developing nervous system Cooper et al., 1995 Serafini et al., 1996 Gad et al., 1997, 1999 Livesey and Hunt, 1997 and some protein expres-sion in the spinal cord MacLennan et al., 1997 , there has been no detailed analysis of the protein expression of either of these genes in the developing forebrain apart from the developing optic nerve Deinier et al., 1997 . To investigate the role of DCC in the development of the forebrain, we performed a detailed analysis of DCC protein expression in the telencephalon and diencephalon and following some of these projections to the mesencephalon . We found that such an analysis implicates DCC in a variety of specific axonal guidance systems in the forebrain in addition to those previously described. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Timed-pregnant female CD1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Wilmington, MA . Mice were housed at the University of Maryland School of Medicine animal facility. Embryos were staged based on a plug date of embryonic day E 0 and were used between E12 and postnatal day P 0. Procedures involving animals were approved by the animal care and use committee at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Fixation and immunohistochemistry On the required day of gestation, pregnant dams were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital Nembutal, Ab-bott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL at 0.07 mg g body weight and placed on a warming pad during surgery to maintain their body temperature. Once deeply anesthe-tized, the motherâs abdomen was opened to expose the uterus. Pups were removed sequentially and placed on ice until deeply anesthetized before perfusion fixation with either saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde 2.5% Acrolein Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA for pups older than E15, or immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde 2.5% Acrolein for younger pups. After perfusion or immersion fixation, the skulls were opened, and the heads were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4Â°C until cutting. Deeply anesthetized dams were killed after the pups were removed by a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital. All sections were cut at 45 Î¼m on a Vibratome Leica, Deerfield, IL and embedded in 3% agarose Noble Agar, Difco, Detroit, MI . Vibratome sections were placed in phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.4 and washed before immunostaining. Sections were immunostained free floating but before the staining procedure were incu-bated in 1% sodium borohydride Sigma, St. Louis, MO for 20 minutes to remove the Acrolein and washed 3 3 10 minutes with PBS. The blocking step was done in 0.2% Triton X-100 Sigma and 2% normal goat serum Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA in PBS for 2 hours. The sections were then incubated overnight in anti-DCC anti-body 2744 rabbit polyclonal at a concentration of 1 30,000 diluted in the blocking solution. Sections were washed 3 3 20 minutes with PBS, incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibody biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Vector Laborato-ries diluted 1 600 in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed another 3 3 20 minutes. Sections were incubated for 1 hour with AB solution Vectastain elite kit, Vector Laboratories made up 1 hour before at 1 500 dilution in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and washed 3 3 10 minutes in PBS. The chromogen solution consisted of 1.25 g of nickel sulfate Sigma dissolved in 50 ml of 0.175 M sodium acetate, followed by one 10-mg tablet of 3,38-diaminobenzi-dine tetrahydrochloride DAB Sigma dissolved in the same solution. The nickel-DAB solution was filtered, and 5 Î¼l of 30% hydrogen peroxide Sigma was added just prior to immersing the sections. The chromogen reaction was terminated by placing the sections in PBS. For double staining with neurofilament and DCC, sections were blocked for 2 hours, and then a polyclonal neurofilament antibody used at 1 50,000 Chemicon, Temecula, CA was applied to the sections overnight. The sections were then washed and incubated in AB solution, as described above. The chromogen used was DAB dissolved in Tris buffered saline pH 7.2 without nickel sulfate. Procedures for the second day of DCC staining were identical to those de-scribed above. Sections were mounted on 2% gelatin-coated glass slides, allowed to air dry, and dehydrated through a series of alcohols before being coverslipped with DPX Sigma mounting medium. Microscopy and production of photomicrographs Mounted sections were analyzed with an upright light microscope Leica . Images for figures were scanned with a PowerPhase digital camera Phase-one, Coppenhagen, Den-mark directly intoAdobe Photoshop software version 4.0 running on a Power Computing Power Center Pro 210 computer. In some cases, alterations of the brightness and or contrast were then made to the images. Images were then labeled, and collages were made for each figure in Adobe Photoshop. Figures were printed on quality photographic paper with a high-resolution color printer Fujix Pictrography 3000 . DISCUSSION The present findings demonstrate that the expression of DCC protein is dynamically regulated by a number of different projecting populations of axons in the developing forebrain. In addition, axons expressing DCC tend to be long-range projecting axons some exceptions include the granule cells of the olfactory bulb that do not have axons Shipley et al., 1995 . Because DCC immunohistochemistry is largely confined to axonal membranes, DCC protein is located predominantly in large fiber tracts such as the lateral olfactory tract, the internal capsule, the corpus callosum, the anterior commissure, the fimbria fornix, the fasciculus retroflexus, and the stria medularis. Given the high expression of DCC on midline commissural axons, our results are consistent with previous findings indicating a role for DCC in the development of commissural pathways. However, our results also indicate that the role of DCC in guiding axons may be more generalized to large fiber tracts containing long-range projecting axons of which these commissural pathways comprise a subset . These results suggest that DCC may be involved in the develop-ment of more axon tracts than previously described by DCC gene knockout analysis Fazeli et al., 1997 . During neocortical development, the lateral axonal pro-jection through the internal capsule is pioneered at E14 in the rat by subplate axons DeCarlos and OâLeary, 1992 . However, the medial axonal projection through the corpus callosum is not pioneered until at least 2 days later in the rat Koester and OâLeary, 1994 . In previous studies, we have shown that this initial laterally directed outgrowth may occur in response to an attractive gradient of Netrin-1 Richards et al., 1997 , which is expressed within the internal capsule Serafini et al., 1996 . In this study, we show two new findings with regard to the development of the efferent neocortical axon projections. First, the Netrin-1-induced attraction of laterally directed neocortical axons may be mediated by DCC expression on these axons during their growth through this region. Second, the expression of DCC on cortical axons reflects this develop-mental difference between the laterally and medially projecting populations. From at least E13, DCC is ex-pressed throughout the intermediate zone and is highly expressed on laterally directed cortical axons within the internal capsule. However, by E16, DCC expression in the internal capsule begins to decrease, whereas expression on medially projecting neurons remains high as these axons cross the midline and form the corpus callosum. Therefore, DCC is downregulated on the lateral projection first, which is consistent with the idea that DCC is only ex-pressed while axons are growing toward their targets in this case, an intermediate target such as the internal capsule . Further analysis of this pathway in the DCC knockout mouse is required to determine the role of DCC in the development of the lateral cortical projection through the internal capsule. DCC is regulated by mammalian homologues of the seven in absentia Siahs gene Hu et al., 1997 . In this pathway, Siahs regulates DCC expression by degrading the protein via the ubiquitinâproteasome pathway, which targets proteins for rapid degradation. One function of this rapid downregulation in DCC protein may be to inhibit DCC-induced cell-death pathways involving caspases Mehlen et al., 1998 once the DCC ligand is removed. Our results show that, once cortical axons leave the region of the internal capsule, which expresses Netrin-1, DCC pro-tein is no longer expressed in axons entering the thala-mus or is greatly downregulated in the corticospinal tract on the distal part of the axon that grows beyond the internal capsule. Soon after this time, DCC expression is downregulated on the whole axon. This suggests a local-ized regulation of DCC expression in the distal part of the axon initially, possibly by Siahs, followed by complete downregulation of DCC in the entire axon. This result also indicates that the DCC Netrin-1 interaction may only be involved in guiding cortical axons to this intermediate target and is not required for growth to the final target or the recognition of the final target of the axon. In further support of a role for DCC in guiding axons to intermediate targets, DCC is highly expressed on many of the major commissural axons within the brain, including the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, and the habenula commissure.All these midline structures may be considered to be ââintermediateââ targets of these axons and implicate DCC in a more general role of commissural formation in the brain and in the spinal cord, as previously described Keino-Masu et al., 1996 . This hypothesis has been supported by the loss of these commissural pathways in the DCC knockout mouse Fazeli et al., 1997 . However, one major difference exists between our findings of DCC protein expression and the phenotype observed in the Netrin-1 and DCC mutant mice. DCC is highly expressed in the habenula commissure, but this structure is present in both mutants. The reason for this difference in findings is unclear. One reason may be that Neogenin may substi-tute for DCC in the development of the habenula commis-sure in the DCC knockout, or that DCC may be involved in either habenula axon guidance or other developmental mechanisms apart from guiding axons across the commis-sure. Because the development of the entire projection of these axons has not been extensively studied in the DCC knockout, we cannot rule out this possibility. Similarly, the lateral olfactory tract has not been studied in the DCC knockout and, therefore, may also show defects not previ-ously described in either the Netrin-1 or DCC knockout. In the anterior commissure, DCC is expressed only until E15 and is completely downregulated by E16. This result also indicates that DCC expression is only present during the targeting phase of axon outgrowth. Previous studies have shown the mRNA for DCC to be present by E11.5 in the developing cortex Gad et al., 1997 . We have found that DCC protein expression is not detectable with this antibody until E13 and is expressed within the intermediate zone and not within the cell bodies of these neurons. In addition, we found that DCC protein expression also remains within these axons 1â2 days after the mRNA is no longer detectable. These findings indicate either that DCC mRNAand protein levels may be indepen-dently regulated or that a threshold amount of DCC protein must be expressed before we can detect it with this antibody. Further expression analysis with antibodies directed toward different regions of the DCC protein will be required to investigate this possibility. We have shown that DCC is expressed in particular populations of projecting axons within the developing forebrain. Although some expression analysis of Netrin-1 mRNA has been performed within the developing fore-brain Livesey and Hunt, 1997 , there has not been a detailed analysis performed of Netrin-1 protein expression within this region. Given that Netrin-1 may diffuse away from its site of synthesis, a detailed analysis of protein expression may be able to reconcile the expression of Netrin-1 within targeting regions of DCC-expressing axons. At present, there are some inconsistencies with the known mRNA expression patterns of Netrin-1 and DCC protein expression. For example, Netrin-1 is not expressed within the cortical plate, hippocampus, or the developing olfac-tory bulb, but DCC protein is highly expressed on axons of these regions. Although this may be resolved with better antibodies to Netrin-1, an alternative explanation is that there are additional ligands for DCC that may be ex-pressed along the pathways of these axons. RESULTS Immunohistochemistry of DCC protein expression was observed only on axonal processes in most cases, in particular those forming large fasciculated axon tracts. Staining of neuronal cell bodies was rarely observed with this antibody. Expression of DCC protein in the developing olfactory system Previous studies of DCC mRNA have shown that the DCC message is expressed in the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs at E18 in the mouse Gad et al., 1997 . Staining with the DCC antibody shows that DCC protein is initially expressed on the axons of mitral cells at E14 Fig. 1A but is not expressed in the granule cell layer until E17 Fig. 1B . Staining within the granule cell layer prob-ably represents the dendrites of granule cells that ramify within the granule cell layer white arrows in Fig. 1C be-cause these cells do not have axons Shipley et al., 1995 . In addition to the mitral cell layer, DCC is expressed on the processes of cells within an outer ring of the bulb that may represent tufted cell axons arrow in Fig. 1B . Tufted cell axons project to the anterior olfactory nucleus AON and the central olfactory cortex Shipley et al., 1995 . Some diffuse DCC staining is present within the AON and on centrifugal fibers in the central olfactory cortex data not shown , indicating that tufted cell axons may be labeled with DCC. The mitral cells and the tufted cells together constitute the major efferent projecting cell types of the olfactory bulb Shipley et al., 1995 . DCC is expressed on projecting axon bundles as they fasciculate and leave the olfactory bulb Fig. 1C to form the lateral olfactory tract Fig. 1D,E . At E17, DCC is highly expressed in the lateral olfactory tract on efferently projecting axons from the olfactory bulbs Fig. 1D to the piriform cortex Fig. 1E . However, by E18, the expression in the lateral olfactory tract and the bulb begins to decline data not shown , indicating that, at least for mitral and tufted cell axons, DCC may only be expressed during the targeting phase of their growth between E13 and E17 in the rat Marchand and Belanger, 1991 Lopez-Mascaraque et al., 1996 . In addition, we observed some DCC labeling within the olfactory tubercle arrow in Fig. 2F , which receives inputs from the olfactory bulb via mitral cells but does not send a reciprocal projection back to the olfactory bulb Shipley et al., 1995 . Therefore, this staining probably corresponds to the mitral and tufted cell inputs rather than to an expres-sion within the tubercle itself. DCC was not observed in the olfactory nerve data not shown , but mRNA expres-sion for DCC has been reported in deep layers of the olfactory epithelium that contain mesodermal and glial cells Livesey and Hunt, 1997 . DCC is expressed on neocortical axons during the targeting phase of growth In the developing neocortex, DCC expression appears to be tightly regulated and restricted to axons as they are projecting. DCC mRNA is first expressed at E11.5 in the developing preplate, where its expression is confined to early postmitotic neurons Gad et al., 1997 . From E13, DCC protein is expressed on the axons of neurons project-ing within the intermediate zone and on axons within the marginal zone but is not expressed within the cortical plate or ventricular zone Fig. 2 . DCC expression within the marginal zone corresponds to that noted in previous reports showing DCC mRNA in neurons within layer 1, which are likely to be CajalâRetzius cells Keino-Masu et al., 1996 . The first axons to project out of the neocortex are the subplate axons that pioneer the internal capsule McCon-nell et al., 1989 DeCarlos and OâLeary, 1992 .Although we failed to detect DCC protein expression at E12, mRNA for DCC is expressed as early as E11.5 in mouse neocortex Gad et al., 1997 . However, DCC protein is highly ex-pressed by E13 Fig. 2A and E14 Fig. 2B,C , probably representing both the subplate pioneers and some axons of layers 5 and 6. Because DCC is not expressed on dorsal thalamic afferents projecting into the neocortex, DCC expression within the internal capsule appears to be specific for cortical efferent axons within this region. It has been previously shown that the lateral projection from the neocortex extends at E14âE15 in rats, approximately 2 days before the medial projection at E16âE17 DeCarlos and OâLeary, 1992 Koester and OâLeary, 1994 Richards et al., 1997 . Our results show that DCC expression reflects a similar developmental difference in directional targeting in mouse. Initially DCC is highly expressed on the lateral projection as it enters the internal capsule Fig. 2C however, by E16, DCC expression is downregulated on these axons, as reflected by a decrease in staining within the internal capsule Fig. 2E . At the same time, DCC expression is maintained on medially projecting neurons both before and during their targeting phase of growth compare Fig. 2C with 2E . Medially projecting neocortical afferents cross the mid-line at E16.4 in mouse Ozaki and Whalsten, 1998 . At this stage of development, DCC is expressed on these axons as they grow toward and cross the midline Fig. 2E . At E17, DCC expression at the midline is observed in both a dorsal region of the corpus callosum and a ventral region. The dorsal region small black arrow in Fig. 2F probably corresponds to callosally projecting cortical axons because this staining is continuous with the projections from each hemisphere. The ventral staining white arrow in Fig. 2F may correspond to a group of axons that defasciculates from the main bundle of axons at the midline, or it may be staining the glial sling, a midline glial ââbridgeââ that directly underlies the corpus callosum at this stage of development Silver et al., 1982 . Callosal axons cross the midline in a temporally and regionally specific manner, with lateral axons crossing first in the ventral region of the corpus callosum CC and medial axons crossing last in the dorsal region of the CC Ozaki and Wahlsten, 1992 . This is also reflected by the regulation of DCC expression. By E18, DCC expression is downregulated on all other axons and is only present in the dorsal region of the CC Fig. 2G . To determine whether DCC expression could be seen in more caudal regions of the corticospinal tract, we cut sections in the sagittal plane of embryos. We found that, after passing through the region of the internal capsule, a small amount of expression was observed in the rostral region of the corticospinal tract Fig. 2H but was not found along the entire tract. These same axons were observed in coronal sections in more caudal regions of the brain making up the cerebral peduncles Fig. 6C . In addition, we did not see DCC expression on cortical axons entering the thalamus Fig. 2H , even at a range of antibody concentrations data not shown , indicating that DCC was not even expressed at low levels by these axons. DCC expression in the hippocampus and the major midline commissures In horizontal sections of the developing forebrain, DCC expression is most evident in the major midline commis-sures. DCC is expressed in the hippocampal commissure Figs. 3E, 4C,D , the CC Figs. 2F,G, 3E , and the anterior commissure Fig. 4E,F . Sections alternately labeled with DCC alone Fig. 3A,C,E or neurofilament and DCC Fig. 3B,D,F show that DCC is expressed before neurofila-ment in some projecting neurons of the hippocampal and callosal commissures. Figure 3C,D illustrates the reduc-tion in DCC expression within the internal capsule at E16 Fig. 3C , despite the high expression of neurofilament in the same axons Fig. 3D . In the developing hippocampus, DCC is expressed by E13.5 in the hippocampal primordia Gad et al., 1997 and is clearly evident in the axonal layer by E14 Fig. 4A but is not seen in the cell bodies of these cells. DCC is expressed in the fiber layer underlying all regions of the hippocam-pus from the dentate gyrus and in regions CA1âCA3. Given that these axons project toward and fasciculate to form the fimbria, it appears that these are extrinsically projecting axons Fig. 4B . DCC continues to be expressed along the entire hippocampal projection toward the mid-line within the fornix and within both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal commissures Fig. 4C,D . The hippo-campal commissure forms approximately 1 day earlier than the CC but continues to form until birth Wahlsten, 1981 Valentino and Jones, 1982 Super and Soriano, 1994 . DCC is also expressed on these hippocampal axons as they first begin to cross the midline at E14âE15 data not shown and during this extended targeting phase of growth. The anterior commissure is the first major commissure to cross the rostral midline in the mouse at E14 but does not have an extended targeting phase of growth Silver et al., 1982 Wahlsten, 1981 . Coincident with this, DCC is expressed within the axons of the anterior commissure at E14 Fig. 4E and E15 Fig. 4F but is completely downregu-lated by E16 data not shown . These results in the CC, hippocampal commissure, and the anterior commissure and those described within the neocortical and olfactory bulb projections suggest that DCC is only expressed on these long-range efferent axons while they are growing toward their targets. Upon reach-ing their targets, DCC is then apparently rapidly downregu-lated. DCC expression in the septum Septal defects have been shown to be associated with agenesis of the CC Wahlsten and Bulman-Fleming, 1994 , a defect seen in both the DCC Fazeli et al., 1997 and Netrin-1 Serafini et al., 1996 mutant mice. The ventral septum is a region of high Netrin-1 mRNA expression K.M. Valentino and L.J. Richards, unpublished observa-tion . Therefore, we wanted to determine where DCC was expressed within this region. The most striking region of DCC expression in the septum is bilaterally in the ventro-medial aspects of the lateral ventricles, corresponding to the ventricular zone of the septum arrowheads in Fig. 2E,F and sep in Fig. 3C . In addition, fibers of the perforant pathway, which run rostrocaudally within the septum, parallel to, and just lateral to the midline, are also labeled with DCC Fig. 2F . DCC expression in the diencephalon The highest DCC expression in the diencephalon is in the epithalamus habenula complex Fig. 5 . DCC expres-sion was evident from E13 and was highly expressed by E14 Fig. 5A,B in this region. DCC is expressed in both medially projecting axons in the habenula commissure hbc in Fig. 5D and ventrally projecting axons running in the lateral region of the diencephalon close to the pial surface, called the stria medularis sm in Fig. 5C , which extend down to the hypothalamus. In addition, DCC is expressed in axons running rostrocaudally through the habenula, seen in cross-section in Figures 5B,D and 6C,E. These axons form two fasciculated bundles of axons called the fasciculus retroflexus fr also known as the habenulo-interpeduncular tract that project to the ventral tegmen-tal area vt , as seen in sagittal sections Fig. 6A,B,D . DCC-expressing axons are also seen within the proximal region of the mammilotegmental tract mtg in Fig. 6D . In the dorsal thalamus, DCC is mostly expressed in medial or limbic regions of dorsal thalamus, particularly in the anterior medial thalamus and periventricular tha-lamic nucleus Fig. 5E , and in the inferior thalamic radiation itr arrowheads in Fig. 6E,F . DCC is also expressed in a band of axons that extend mediolaterally between the dorsal and ventral thalamus in the region of the external medullary lamina not shown . In the ventral aspect of the diencephalon, DCC is highly expressed in the optic chiasm Fig. 5F and bilaterally in the rostromedial region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus Fig. 5F . We have also shown DCC protein expression within the developing retina and optic nerve T. Shu and L.J. Richards, unpublished observations therefore, the expression of DCC within the optic chiasm is consistent with this finding and suggests that DCC may play a role in axon targeting of the optic nerve in regions distal to the retina. In more caudal sections, DCC is expressed within the nigrostriatal pathway nsp Fig. 6C,E,F , corresponding to previous reports of DCC mRNA expression within the substantia nigra Livesey and Hunt, 1996 Gad et al., 1997 .

Many studies in adult Anamniotes, for example, fish group Osteichthyes and frog group Amphibia , have shown that the severed optic nerve can regenerate to restore vision. Regenerating optic axons follow the visual pathway to re-establish, refine, and stabilize topographi-cally organized projections in retino-recipient brain cen-tres. The recovery is sufficient to allow capture of moving prey using information via the regenerated optic nerve Sperry, 1951 Gaze, 1970 Beazley, 1984 Jacobson, 1991 Dunlop et al., 1997a . By contrast, in adult Amniotes such as Aves birds and Mammalia mammals , the optic nerve exhibits an abortive regenerative response axons eventually degenerate along with their parent retinal ganglion cell bodies, and blindness persists Ramo Â´n y Cajal, 1928 Clemente, 1964 Kiernan, 1979 Muchnick and Hibbard, 1980 Aguayo et al., 1983 . The Reptilia are Amniotes and originated after the Osteichthyes or Amphibia but at an earlier date than the Aves and the Mammalia Kardong, 1997 and until re-cently have received less attention as a model for optic nerve regeneration Rio et al., 1989 . Our studies of the long-term outcome of optic nerve regeneration in the ornate dragon lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus Order Squa-mata, Subclass Diapsida Kardong, 1997 , have shown a pattern transitional between that of the fishes and frogs and the birds and mammals Beazley et al., 1997 . As in frog Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 Beazley et al., 1986 Singman and Scalia, 1991 , in lizard up to approximately two-thirds of the ganglion cells survive axotomy and re-innervate the main primary visual centre, the optic tectum, as well as minor visual centres. However, the regenerated projection in lizard is highly abnormal, show-ing no anatomical Beazley et al., 1997 or physiological evidence Dunlop et al., 1997b Stirling et al., 1999 of topographic order. In line with these findings, animals are functionally blind. The ornate dragon lizard provides the first model of a dissociation between optic axon re-growth and topographic map formation within a visual target as well as non-functional optic nerve regeneration. We have now ex-tended our studies of optic nerve regeneration in this species by examining early and intermediate stages of re-innervation to complement both the long-term data and a recent electrophysiological study showing a transient, low-fidelity topographic projection between 4 and 6 months Stirling et al., 1999 . The topographic map was detected amongst the persistently disorganised axonal projection as judged anatomically. Presumably, a small proportion of terminals or parts thereof that are in appropriate locations are more likely to be functional than inappropriately located ones. However, the electrophysiologically detect-able order is lost beyond 6 months as axons presumably continue to search but fail to consolidate a retinotectal map. Here we have used anterograde labelling with the carbocyanine dye 1,18-dioctadecyl-3,3,38,38-tetramethylin-docarbocyanine perchlorate DiI to examine three aspects of the anatomical organisation of the retinal projections, namely, the time course, accuracy, and stability. First, we asked how quickly the regenerating axons regain the visual centres. In goldfish and frog, optic axons regenerate rapidly, reaching the tectum by approximately 2â4 weeks with restoration of vision by 2â3 months Stelzner et al., 1981 Murray and Edwards, 1982 Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 Singman and Scalia, 1991 . By contrast, in a snake, Vipera aspis, regeneration is much slower, with axons approaching the optic tectum as late as 7 months Rio et al., 1989 recovery of vision was not tested. If regeneration proved to be delayed in the lizard also, the resultant prolonged de-afferentiation might lead, as in other sys-tems, to a loss of post-synaptic elements, ectopic sprouting, and or an altered expression of guidance cues or other chemical markers Miguel-Hildago et al., 1990 Reperant et al., 1991 Wizenmann and Bahr, 1997 . These changes would possibly alter the target and prevent regenerating axons from re-forming a topographic map. Second, we examined several aspects of the accuracy of regeneration. We wished to confirm and extend observa-tions that the retinotectal projection lacks anatomical evidence of retinotopic order throughout regeneration Stirling et al., 1999 . In addition, we determined whether misrouting occurred within and or outside the visual path-way since pathfinding errors might deplete the number of axons available to establish topographic projections. We determined whether the appropriate retino-recipient tec-tal layers are re-innervated. For example, in both goldfish and frog, contralaterally the depth of the retino-recipient tectal layers are re-innervated Meyer, 1980 Stuermer and Easter, 1984 Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 . However, ipsilaterally, in goldfish there is an enhanced but tempo-rary projection to inappropriate laminae Springer, 1980 , whereas in frogs a permanently enhanced ipsilateral pro-jection incorrectly favours the superficial rather than the deep layers Stelzner et al., 1981 . We also sought evidence for projections to inappropriate visual regions such as axons seen entering the unoperated optic nerve of frog Bohn and Stelzner, 1981a,b Tennant et al., 1993 . More-over, we determined whether axons exit their normal pathway entirely such as occurs during spinal cord regen-eration in goldfish when axons preferentially enter the ventral roots Bentley and Zottoli, 1993 . Third, we examined the stability of the regenerate projections and asked whether they consolidate with time, as in goldfish and frog Murray, 1982 Murray and Ed-wards, 1982 Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 Stelzner and Strauss, 1986 , or whether they become less substantial. In frog, a retraction of afferent input occurs in the long term when, for example, the optic nerve is implanted into a non-standard target such as the olfactory cortex Scalia, 1987 or when a foreign nerve, such as the mandibular, is forced to innervate the optic tectum Kaplan and Clem-ente, 1985 . Some of this work has been reported in abstract form Tran et al., 1996 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and surgery Our procedures for maintaining adult C. ornatus, per-forming surgery, and labelling projections matched those in our previous study Beazley et al., 1997 . Briefly, lizards were maintained at a background temperature of 22 6 2Â°C sun lamps illuminated rocks for 14 hours a day, allowing lizards to bask at temperatures of 25â30Â°C. Lizards were fed with insects two or three times a week, and water was provided. Anaesthesia for optic nerve crushes was by inhalation of halothane, with cooling to minimise bleeding terminal anaesthesia was induced with sodium brietal 0.05 mg 10 gm body weight, IP . The left optic nerve was accessed extracranially via a dorsal cut to the skin overlying the orbit the eye was eased forward and the optic nerve crushed with watchmakerâs forceps no. 5 until a clear break was visible across the nerve parenchyma. The skin was then re-apposed and held in place with cyanoacrylate. Previous studies indicated that our crush procedure severed all axons in the optic nerve at approximately two-thirds the distance from the eye to the chiasm but preserved the blood supply to the eye and left the nerve sheath intact as a conduit for regenerat-ing axons Beazley et al., 1997 . Approval was given by the Animal Welfare Committee, The University of Western Australia, and lizards were collected under licence Conser-vation and Land Management . Axonal tracing Terminally anaesthetised lizards were perfused transcar-dially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and the eyes dissected with optic nerves and brains attached. To examine the entire projection, the tracer DiI Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR was applied as crystals to cover the optic disk. To study the topicity of the regenerated retinotectal projection, a small crystal of DiI was placed in the nerve fibre layer temporal to the dorsally located fovea, a procedure that labelled approximately 5â10% of retinal area in addition, for normal animals a crystal of 4-4-dihexadecylaminostyrl 1-N methylpyri-dinium iodide DiASP was placed nasal to the fovea see Fig. 3K . After 6 weeks at 37Â°C for transport, optic nerves were severed immediately behind the eye. The brains with the optic nerves attached were embedded in gelatin albumin, Vibratome-sectioned at 100 Î¼m, mounted in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde, and photographed. For the series in which the entire projection was labelled, sections were analysed using fluorescence microscopy and Ekta-chrome 400 colour-positive film. In some sections, labelled axons and their terminals were photo-oxidised with diami-nobenzidine to produce a permanent reaction product Maranto, 1982 and examined using Nomarski optics. Analysis using the confocal microscope BioRad MRC wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm, T1 and T2A blocks and Kalman filtering facilitated the visualisation of the lighter labelling achieved in the study of retinotopicity. Pilot studies indicated that the arrangement of optic axons was best revealed in a plane of section that was coronal but tilted approximately 30Â° posteriorly Fig. 1A, inset . In this way, within one section, we captured the optic nerve, chiasm, and optic tract longitudinally and the optic tecta transversely Figs. 1, 3, 4 . However, for comparison with studies in fish and frog, we illustrate here the distribution of regenerated axons on tem-plates showing the entire visual pathway sectioned trans-versely Fig. 2 . All figures were produced by using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Pagemaker and Corel Draw software. DISCUSSION In summary, the time course of regeneration in lizard is reported here to be similar to that in goldfish and frog. However, our results indicate two profound abnormalities that are unique to the lizard. First, regeneration is less precise. Throughout, there is a considerable variability between animals, an inability of axons to follow topo-graphic cues, and a variety of pathfinding and targeting errors. Second, the regenerated projections appear less stable than those in goldfish or frog, becoming weaker with time. The diminishing innervation may reflect an inability to recognise appropriate partner cells within the visual centres. Time course In lizard, the time course whereby regenerating optic axons first reach visual centres by 1 month is similar to that in goldfish Murray and Edwards, 1982 , the leopard frog Rana pipiens Stelzner et al., 1981 , and the frog Litoria moorei Humphrey and Beazley, 1982, 1985 . The light projection that we report here between 1 and 2 months supports our electrophysiological observation that only inconsistent visually evoked responses can be re-corded at 2 months Stirling et al., 1999 . Our results rule out the possibility that prolonged de-afferentiation is a factor preventing the reformation of retinotopic projec-tions. The rapid time course of optic nerve regeneration in lizard contrasts with the slow response in the snake, V. aspis, the only other reptile in which optic nerve regenera-tion has been reported Rio et al., 1989 . Even at 7 months, the longest postoperative period studied in the snake, the tectum was not completely re-innervated, precluding an analysis of whether the projection could achieve retino-topic order. The differing time courses of optic nerve regeneration in lizard and snake suggest an association between the success of regeneration and the degree of myelination. Only 20% of optic axons are myelinated in the normal lizard Beazley et al., 1997 but over 80% in the snake Rio et al., 1989 . In mammals, myelin-associated inhibitory molecules prevent central nerve regeneration Berry, 1982 Caroni and Schwab, 1988 Schwab, 1990 McKerracher et al., 1994 . However, data are conflicting as to whether such molecules exist in species which display successful central nerve regeneration. Ultrastructural and in vitro studies in goldfish and Xenopus laevis support the view that central myelin in these species lacks inhibitory molecules Bastmeyer et al., 1991 Strobel and Stuermer, 1994 Lang et al., 1995 Wanner et al., 1995 . Other studies suggest that such molecules are normally present in the goldfish optic nerve but become down-regulated after nerve damage Bedi et al., 1992 Sivron et al., 1994 . If myelin-associated inhibitory factors are the major inhibi-tory influence on axon regeneration in reptiles, the high proportion of myelinated axons in snake may present a more hostile environment to regenerating axons than the low proportion in lizard. It should also be borne in mind that the optic nerve was lesioned intracranially in snake Rio et al., 1989 but extracranially in lizards. The extracranial procedure, as in frog Humphrey and Beazley, 1983, 1985 , leaves the dural sheath intact as a conduit for regenerating axons. By contrast, the intracranial portion of the optic nerve is surrounded only by the pia mater. Injury at this site in frog results in considerable damage and substantial axonal misrouting as a consequence, the time course of regenera-tion is often slower than that after extracranial lesion Humphrey and Beazley, 1982, 1983 . By analogy, we would predict a faster rate of optic nerve regeneration in V. aspis if the lesion was made extracranially. Accuracy Here, we have extended our observations suggesting a lack of anatomical evidence for retinotopicity in the contra-lateral tectum during optic nerve regeneration in lizard Stirling et al., 1999 . Localised labelling within the retina was reported to result in axons spreading throughout the superficially located stratum opticum of the contralateral optic tectum as viewed in whole brain preparations. We show here using sectioned material that axons are spread throughout both the contralateral and ipsilateral stratum opticum as well as the more deeply situated retino-recipient tectal layers, suggesting that they lack any semblance of retinotopic order. The results extend our previous observation of a lack of retinotopicity at 1 year Beazley et al., 1997 and show anatomically that topo-graphic order is lacking throughout optic nerve regenera-tion in the lizard. The situation in lizard contrasts with that in goldfish in which, although they search widely within the stratum opticum, regenerating axons neverthe-less finally form terminals within the retino-recipient layers that are topographically correct Stuermer, 1988a,b Meyer and Kageyama, 1999 . We also report other inaccuracies both inside and out-side the visual pathway throughout regeneration. Misrout-ing within the visual pathway in lizard is more extensive and persistent than in goldfish or frog. For example, in lizard, the ipsilateral projection persists and spreads to all retino-recipient tectal layers. By contrast, in goldfish the regenerated projection to the ipsilateral tectum is tempo-rary, being removed by 1 month post crush Springer, 1980 in the frog R. pipiens, the projection is heavier than normal but nevertheless favours tectal regions close to the optic brachia and inappropriately occupies only the most superficial of the retino-recipient layers Stelzner et al., 1981 . As another example, in lizard a projection remains within the unoperated optic nerve for at least 12 months, whereas it is withdrawn by between 5â7 and 8â20 weeks in the frogs R. pipiens Bohn and Stelzner, 1981b and L. moorei, respectively Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 Ten-nant et al., 1993 . In lizard, even more severe misrouting occurs such that regenerating axons spontaneously leave the visual path-way altogether, whereas in goldfish and frog they remain exclusively within it Bernhardt and Easter, 1986 Stu-ermer and Easter, 1984 Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 . For example, in lizard, regenerating axons enter territory such as the olfactory bulb, whereas in frog, the olfactory system is innervated only after extreme measures such as surgical deflection of the optic nerve Scalia, 1987 . For goldfish and frog there appears to be a hierarchy whereby regenerating axons can be attracted outside visual areas. If visual centres remain intact, they are preferentially innervated even if adjacent non-visual areas are denervated by surgical ablation. Thus, in goldfish, regenerating axons re-innervate the normal tectal retino-recipient layers, the stratum fibrosum et griseum superfi-ciale, even if the overlying stratum fibrosum marginale is denervated by removing the torus longitudinalis and cut-ting the tectal commissure Marotte, 1984 . Similarly, in frog, regenerating optic axons regain the optic tectum and ignore foreign territories adjacent to the optic tract even when these have been denervated by transection of the brainstem through the isthmal region Bohn and Stelzner, 1980 . By contrast, if the optic tectum is removed in goldfish, non-visual areas can become innervated, with regenerat-ing axons penetrating a number of tectal efferent path-ways to the forebrain, cerebellum, and medulla Lo and Levine, 1980, 1981 . In normal reptiles, the nucleus rotun-dus receives tectal efferents Butler and Northcutt, 1971 Karten and Rezvin, 1966 , whereas the tectal commissure represents a higher order pathway joining regions which receive primary visual input. We show here that regenerat-ing optic axons in lizard are attracted to these visually associated regions even in the intact brain. It may be that a loss of retinotopic input to the optic tectum leads to changes such as reactive gliosis within the tectal efferent projections Lo and Levine, 1980, 1981 that render these regions attractive to regenerating axons. Additionally, or as an alternative, regenerating axons may be diverted to visually associated regions as a result of trans-neuronal degeneration Valverde and Esteban, 1968 secondary to retinal ganglion cell death Beazley et al., 1997 however, we have yet to establish whether tectal cells die during optic nerve regeneration in lizard. The relaxation in lizard in terms of the specificity of regenerating axons for the pathways followed and regions innervated may relate to the timing of neurogenesis. In goldfish and frog, retinal ganglion cells are generated throughout life Straznicky and Gaze, 1971 Meyer, 1978 Coleman et al., 1984 , presumably requiring that develop-mental cues be maintained to direct the axons of newly generated retinal ganglion cells. In lizard, retinal ganglion cell generation does not persist into adulthood Beazley et al., 1998 , obviating the need for maintaining developmen-tal guidance cues that would therefore no longer be available to regenerating axons. Although the misrouting of regenerating axons that we observed in lizard might be thought to significantly dimin-ish numbers available to reform a retinotopic map in the tectum, we consider this possibility to be unlikely. Theoreti-cal analyses have suggested that an organised projection can still form when the number of retinal ganglion cell axons is reduced by 50% Hope et al., 1982 . In a previous study, we showed that two-thirds of retinal ganglion cells survive in the long term after optic nerve crush in the lizard Beazley et al., 1997 . Furthermore, the high num-ber of axons in the segment of the optic nerve distal to the lesion site Beazley et al., 1997 suggests that surviving retinal ganglion cells each possess a regenerated axon. We show here that tectal labelling is intense at least between 3 and 5 months, indicating that most retinal ganglion cell axons reach the brain. The survival of retinal ganglion cells and their axons in lizard matches the most extensive values found in frog Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 and by far exceeds the 20% that has been shown to support visually guided behaviour Singman and Scalia, 1991 , an activity presumably needing a topographic retinotectal map. Stability The other major abnormality revealed in our study is that, unlike the long-term retinotectal projections in gold-fish and frog, those in lizard are unstable. The instability of the regenerate projection to the tectum and the variable pattern of innervation in other regions of the brain for lizard are consistent with the observation that retinal ganglion cells remain chromatolysed for up to a year after nerve crush Beazley et al., 1997 . The chromatolytic reaction to axotomy is associated with axon growth Grafs-tein and McQuarrie, 1978 , suggesting that, in lizard, regenerating axons continue to search for appropriate partner cells. By contrast, in fish or frogs, chromatolysis is transient, with retinal ganglion cells returning to their normal appearance by 3â4 months Murray and Grafstein, 1969 Murray and Forman, 1971 Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 Beazley et al., 1986 Humphrey, 1988 as axon growth ceases and the topographic projections stabilise Humphrey and Beazley, 1985 Schmidt, 1993 . The ââwaxing and waningââ of the tectal regenerated projection occurs despite the formation of synaptic boutons which appear to be functional since we have recorded visually evoked responses that we consider to be postsyn-aptic Stirling et al., 1999 . Moreover, the observation that the projections appear most robust between 3 and 5 months and subsequently wane accords with the physiologi-cal findings of partial retinotopicity within this intermedi-ate period and a breakdown of order thereafter. The instability of the visual projection in lizard is reminiscent of that seen when motor axons are misdirected into inappropriate muscles functional connections are formed but are later eliminated Mark, 1980 . Furthermore, when the optic nerve is surgically induced to enter an entirely inappropriate target such as the olfactory cortex in frog, the projection is also unstable. The projection increases up to 10 weeks, and appears most robust between 18 and 30 weeks but shows a marked reduction thereafter, being absent at 50 weeks Scalia, 1987 . Although synapses can be identified ultrastructurally, unlike the lizard, the projec-tion remains partially topographic Scalia, 1987 Scalia et al., 1997 . However, if the escape route to visual targets is blocked by surgically separating the lateral wall of the hemisphere from the diencephalon, the optic projection persists within the cortex for longer than 1 year Scalia et al., 1995 . It thus appears that, despite forming functional synapses, optic axons vary in their ability to maintain these connections. If they lack topographic order within an appropriate target, as in the lizard optic tectum, they are unstable if, however, they have some topographic order within an inappropriate target, as in the frog olfactory cortex, they are maintained only if the escape route is blocked Scalia, 1987 Scalia et al., 1995 . The long-term unsuccessful search for appropriate tar-get cells in the adult lizard suggests a deficiency in cues for map-making and or the stabilisation of projections. A number of developmental studies have identified the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands as a class of map-making molecules which are expressed in complemen-tary gradients across the retina and tectum during devel-opment in fish, chick, and rodents Cheng and Flanagan, 1994 Drescher et al., 1995 Nakamoto et al., 1996 Mon-schau et al., 1997 . We have recently shown that the ligands Ephrin A2 and A5 are expressed in the retinotectal system during development in lizard however, only Eph-rinA2 is detectable during optic nerve regeneration Rodger et al., 1999 . Despite the re-expression of Ephrin A2, as we show here, axons fail to sustain a topographic map, suggesting that possibly other molecules are required. Our results suggest that the lizard undergoes less complete and successful optic nerve regeneration com-pared with fish and frogs. If the trend extends to mam-mals, our results may have implications for strategies necessary to induce optic nerve regeneration in humans. RESULTS Normal lizards Visual projections were examined in normal lizards n 5 4 for the entire projection and n 5 2 for the retinotopic-ity study to expand previous descriptions for C. ornatus Beazley et al., 1997 the terminologies are those used for other lizards by Northcutt and Butler 1974 and Reperant et al. 1978 . The optic nerve measured 1.5â2 mm in length and 0.8â1.0 mm in diameter as in frogs, axons occupied its entire cross section Fig. 1G , with no evidence for the central canal seen in newt Turner and Singer, 1974 . In whole brains, axons from each eye formed three major chiasmal fingers and one minor one at the chiasm these alternated with equivalent chiasmal fingers from the other eye and appeared as interlocking fingers Fig. 1B, lower inset . Analysis of sections confirmed that axons from the left eye extended through the lowermost, third, fifth, and seventh chiasmal fingers while those from the right eye traversed the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth chiasmal fingers Fig. 1A,B,G . Most axons decussated to enter the contralateral optic tract. There was a minor projection to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and, at the base of the optic tract, a small component of the projection travelled caudally via the basal optic root to innervate the nucleus opticus tegmenti the accessory optic nucleus . Most axons continued to ascend the optic tract, a component innervating the pars dorsalis Fig. 1C and pars ventralis of the nucleus genicu-latis lateralis. In addition, projections were observed to the nucleus geniculatus pretectalis, the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, the nucleus griseus tectalis Fig. 1C , and the nucleus posterodorsalis. The most prominent projec-tion, however, was via the medial and lateral optic brachia to innervate the optic tectum Fig. 1A,B . Input terminated in the superficial layers as a series of laminae that were most clearly defined laterally Fig. 1C . The retinotectal projection was highly organised topographically such that, in our preparations, dorsotemporal axons were seen to terminate rostrolaterally and dorsonasal ones more medi-ally Fig. 3J,K . A sparse projection to the ipsilateral side of the brain was also seen. For the left optic nerve, the projection traversed the third and fifth chiasmal fingers and as-cended the superficial edge of the optic tract Fig. 1B, upper inset to innervate the pars ventralis of the nucleus geniculatis lateralis Fig. 1F , the pars dorsalis of the nucleus geniculatis lateralis, the nucleus geniculatus pre-tectalis, and the nucleus griseus tectalis Fig. 1D . In addition, a small number of axons terminated in the deepest retino-recipient layer of the rostrolateral extrem-ity of the tectum Fig. 1D . Experimental lizards Lizards were studied at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after optic nerve crush. At each stage, the entire projections were examined in two lizards and retinotopic-ity in another as exceptions, the entire projections were examined in one lizard at 5 months and another at 8 months. Individual lizards are referred to by the month of sacrifice followed by the animal number e.g., 1 1 is 1 month lizard 1 . In summary, axons reached the optic tecta between 1 and 2 months, and projections were robust at 3â5 months but from 6 months onward became less substantial.Although most optic axons regenerated within the visual pathway, the tectal projection lacked evidence of retinotopicity throughout moreover, axons displayed con-siderable misrouting, which gave rise to persistent projec-tions to the unoperated optic nerve, the ipsilateral side of the brain, and to regions outside the visual pathway. Optic nerve. The external aspect of the experimental optic nerve showed evidence of sustained damage in that it did not return to a normal colour or homogenous appear-ance rather, in whole brain preparations, the crush site at 1 and 2 months appeared as a distinct pale band that spanned the width of the optic nerve Fig. 3A . With time, the pale zone extended toward both the eye and the brain Fig. 3D,G , presumably as a result of prolonged retro-grade as well as anterograde demyelination. Reconstructions of sectioned material showed that regen-erating axons occupied the full extent of the optic nerve between the eye and the crush site at all stages examined, suggesting that axons did not withdraw toward the eye but rather re-grew from their cut ends. From 1 month onward, axons were seen beyond the crush site, coursing through most parts of the optic nerve. In all instances, however, axons avoided one or more regions that varied in size between animals and were situated mostly within the core but sometimes more peripherally Figs. 2, 4A,B . Chiasm. Regenerating axons favoured the eye-specific chiasmal fingers but also entered those originating from the other eye and were sometimes observed within the meningeal sheath Fig. 4C . Axons occupied only parts of the eye-specific fingers in all except one lizard 3 2, Fig. 2 . Within individual animals, the occupancy varied between the eye-specific chiasmal fingers, and no time-related trends were apparent Fig. 2 . In some cases, regions lacking innervation within the chiasmal fingers appeared to represent a continuation of the regions that were devoid of regenerating axons in the nerve 4 2, 10 2, Fig. 2 . Optic tracts and minor visual centres. Contralaterally, axons had extended along the length of the tract by 1 month. Projections were most substantial between 3 and 5 months and diminished beyond 6 months. Figs. 2, 3C,E-,F,H,I , when the tract also appeared thinner Fig. 4E . Throughout, axons favoured the borders of the tract, although the pattern of label varied considerably between individuals Figs. 2, 4DâF . In some animals 2 2 5 1, 10 2, Fig. 2 6 1, 10 1 , axons also formed fine bundles within the core. All the minor visual centres became re-innervated from 3 months. Ipsilaterally, at 1 month, the projection in the optic tract was light and had yet to reach the dorsocaudal extremity. At 2 months, and at all subsequent stages, the projection was heavier than normal, although, as on the contralateral side, the projection was heaviest between 3 and 5 months Figs. 2, 3C,E,F,G,H . Throughout, axons favoured the borders of the tract but, for some animals, also formed fine bundles within the core 2 2, 3 2, 4 1, 5 1, 8 1, 10 2, Fig. 2 10 1, 12 1 Fig. 4F . Minor nuclei became re-innervated by 3 months, and input was abnormally heavy. Optic tecta. Bilaterally, the projection was found within only the retino-recipient layers, was initially light, and became robust at 3â5 months but weakened thereafter. Throughout, the regenerate projections to both tecta lacked evidence of retinotopic axon order with dorsotemporal axons spreading over the rostrocaudal and mediolateral extents of the tectum Fig. 3LâN . Contralateral tectal projections were re-established be-tween 1 and 2 months, although there was considerable variability between animals. Input was either light such that individual terminals with synaptic boutons could be identified throughout the depth of the retino-recipient layers 1 1, 2 1 Figs. 2, 4HâJ , or the projection was heavier and either favoured the superficial layers 1 2, 2 1, Fig. 2 or occupied its depth 2 2, Fig. 2 . From 3 to 5 months, the projection was consistently robust across the entire tectum, with axons occupying the full depth of the retino-recipient layers Figs. 2, 3F . From 6 months, the projection appeared weaker and displayed more variability both across the tectum and be-tween animals Figs. 2, 3H,I . Throughout, layering, as in normal lizards, was most distinct rostrolaterally Fig. 4K . Ipsilaterally, regenerating axons re-innervated the retino-recipient layers of the tectum later than on the contralateral side, input being delayed until 2 months. Although innervation was abnormally heavy, in most instances it was less intense than that seen contralaterally Figs. 3C,F,I, 4KâM . Exceptions were lizards at 6 and 10 months in which the projections were of equivalent inten-sity bilaterally in rostral to midtectal 6 2, Fig. 2 or caudal 10 1, Fig. 4N patches. In one lizard at 2 months, axons were distributed as a sparse projection of individual terminals throughout the depth of the caudal retino-recipient layers and were absent rostrally 2 1, Fig. 2 in the other lizard a dense projection favoured the deep retino-recipient layers rostrally but the deep and superfi-cial layers in mid-and caudal tectum 2 2, Fig. 2 . As for the contralateral tectum, input was strongest at 3â5 months Figs. 2, 3F . However, unlike the contralateral side, the projection appeared uneven. In several animals, axons favoured the deep and superficial retino-recipient layers in some regions of the tectum. For the remainder, axons occupied the full depth but in patches that varied between individuals. As an exception, in one individual, axons favoured the deep retino-recipient layers with only a sparse innervation of the superficial ones 5 1, Fig. 2 . Between 6 and 12 months, the projection appeared less robust than at earlier stages, matching the diminution seen contralaterally Figs. 2, 3I . Abnormal projections. A number of abnormal projec-tions were seen within and without the confines of the visual pathway. All animals from 1 month onward, even those at 12 months, possessed a projection within the unoperated optic nerve Fig. 4G . The projection varied in its location between individuals, but the variability did not correlate with the time post crush Fig. 2 . In most animals, axons favoured the medial periphery but in several others were more widespread and in some cases encroached on the ventral aspect 2 1, 3 2, 4 1, 4 2, 6 2, 8 1, 10 2, Fig. 2 10 1, 12 1 . Although optic axons within the brain were confined to the visual pathways at 1 and 2 months, from 3 months onward, most experimental animals displayed innervation of regions beyond the visual pathway. The nucleus rotun- dus was labelled bilaterally 3 1, 3 2, 4 1, 6 2, 10 2, 12 2 Fig. 4O or contralaterally 5 1 . In addition, labelling was observed within the tectal commissure 4 2, 6 2, 10 2, 12 1, 12 2 Fig. 4P , the posterior commissure 3 2, 4 2, 5 1 Fig. 4O , and the hypothalamus 6 2 12 2 Fig. 4C . One animal displayed severe misrouting in the chiasm, allowing axons to enter the olfactory tract to travel rostrally within the olfactory nerve 12 1 Fig. 3O . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank W.

Upon maturation, calbindin is drastically reduced or entirely lost in many auditory nuclei. We made cochleotomies in mature rats to study effects of deafening and deafferentation on the expression of calbindin in the auditory brainstem. Following unilateral cochleotomy, we observed a substantial increase in the number of calbindin-immunoreactive fibers and boutons in the ventral subdivisions of the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus. At the same time, calbindin-positive astrocytes emerged in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus. Beyond the immediately affected ipsilateral cochlear nucleus, we found calbindin-positive neurons in the lateral superior olive and in the central inferior colliculus, both contralateral to the operation. The loss of one cochlea reduces auditory input and puts the flow of neuronal activity originating in the two ears out of balance. Our findings indicate that the need for the neuronal networks in the auditory brainstem to adjust to this drastically changed pattern of sensory signals invokes the expression of calbindin in glial cells as well as in directly and indirectly affected neuronal cell populations.</AbstractText></Citation></Article>

In several cases, there were multiple foci of high amplitude EPs lying along this acoustically active portion of STG. EPs recorded simultaneously from HG and STG differed in their sensitivities to general anesthesia and to changes in rate of stimulus presentation. Results indicate that the acoustically active region on the STG is a separate auditory area, functionally distinct from the HG auditory field s . We refer to this acoustically sensitive area of the STG as the posterior lateral superior temporal area PLST . Electrical stimulation of HG resulted in short-latency EPs in an area that overlaps PLST, indicating that PLST receives a corticocortical input, either directly or indirectly, from HG. These physiological findings are in accord with anatomic evidence in humans and in nonhuman primates that the superior temporal cortex contains multiple interconnected auditory areas. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 79â92, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The functional organization of auditory cortex has been studied extensively in a number of mammalian species, including nonhuman primates for reviews see Bonin and Bailey, 1947 Bailey et al., 1950 Brugge, 1982 FitzPatrick and Imig, 1982 Aitkin, 1990 Brugge and Reale, 1985 Suga, 1988 Clarey et al., 1992 Kaas and Hackett, 1998 Rauschecker, 1998a,b Schreiner, 1992, 1998 . In the hu-man, however, we still have only a rudimentary under-standing of the functional organization of this part of the brain, despite knowing for more than a century that the cortex on the superior temporal gyrus STG plays a critical role in hearing, speech, and language. There is general agreement that in humans the primary auditory field AI is located deep within the lateral fissure on a small patch of the transverse gyrus of Heschl HG having distinctive cyto-and myelo-architectonic features Flech-sig, 1896 Vogt, 1903 Campbell, 1905 Brodmann, 1909 Economo, 1929 Bailey and Von Bonin, 1951 Hopf, 1964 Galaburda and Sanides, 1980 Seldon, 1981, 1985 , that it is tonotopically organized Pantev et al., 1988, 1995 Howard et al., 1996a Lu Â¨tkenho Â¨ner and Steinstra Â¨ter, 1998 , and that it exhibits auditory-evoked responses having latencies shorter than those recorded from more lateral sites Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1991, 1994 . There is far less agreement and understanding about the cytoarchitectoni-cally distinct fields that together constitute âbeltsâ of audi-tory cortex surrounding AI, including fields on the lateral aspect of the STG. Recently, Kaas and Hackett 1998 proposed a scheme of auditory cortical organization for New World and Old World monkeys based on available anatomic and electro-physiological evidence. According to this scheme, cortical processing of acoustic information may involve 15 or more interconnected cortical areas, grouped into four or more processing levels. Cortical fields at each level receive parallel thalamic input and interact serially with each other and with distant fields over corticocortical networks. Implicit in such a model is the concept that cortical fields outside the primary field s engage in higher-order com-plex processing, and results of single neuron studies in monkey are consistent with this hypothesis Rauschecker et al., 1995 Rauschecker, 1998a,b . In the human, func-tional imaging Petersen et al., 1988 Binder et al., 1994, 1996, 1997 Fiez et al., 1995, 1996 Griffiths et al., 1998 and direct electrophysiological recording Ojemann and Engel, 1986 Creutzfeldt et al., 1987 Ojemann et al., 1988 Steinschneider et al., 1999 also suggest that these belt areas engage in complex sound processing in ways that are distinct from AI. Understanding the respective roles that each of these auditory areas plays in hearing, speech, and language requires gaining new knowledge about their locations, physiological boundaries, functional organiza-tions and connections. To gain such information, we have begun to study human auditory cortex directly by using intracranial recording and electrical stimulation methods. The subjects were patients undergoing evaluation and surgical treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. There is considerable intersubject and interhemispheric variability of temporal lobe gyral patterns Geshwind and Levinsky, 1968 Galaburda and Sanides, 1980 Steinmetz et al., 1989 Penhune et al., 1996 Leonard et al., 1998 and their relationships to underlying cytoarchitecture, which have complicated efforts to understand the functional organization of human auditory cortical fields. Single-neuron mapping of auditory cortex in laboratory animals, including nonhuman primates, indicates clearly that the location, boundaries, and organization of auditory fields with respect to gyral patterns also vary considerably between subjects e.g., Merzenich and Brugge, 1973 Mer-zenich et al., 1975 . The earliest recording Celesia et al., 1968 Celesia and Puletti, 1969, 1971 Puletti and Celesia, 1970 Celesia, 1976 and stimulation experiments Pen-field and Perot, 1963 performed on human auditory cortex were carried out acutely during surgery thus, it was not feasible in any single subject to study electrophysiological or behavioral responses in detail or to map in any system-atic way their spatial representations. These problems have now been partially circumvented by the introduction of two experimental approaches. The first is the ability to obtain in a single subject systematic data from many cortical sites with relatively high spatial resolution, thereby reducing localization errors that necessarily occur when data from mapping experiments are pooled across subjects see also Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1991, 1994 Boatman et al., 1994 . The second is three-dimensional magnetic reso-nance imaging MRI Damasio and Frank, 1992 Frank et al., 1997 , which in our studies serves as an essential guide for electrode placement and for later alignment of cortical recording sites with anatomic landmarks. The results presented in this study were derived from multicontact subdural recording arrays that were im-planted over the lateral surface of the STG and, in a select subset of these patients, from multicontact modified depth electrodes Howard et al., 1996b inserted into HG. This chronic recording approach provided the opportunity to study over a period of several days in an individual subject the properties of acoustically evoked potentials, to map the spatial distribution s of the averaged EPs, and to compare the averaged EP waveforms recorded simultaneously from lateral STG and HG. In the course of these studies, EPs were recorded within a limited area on the lateral surface of posterior STG and in HG. EPs recorded simultaneously from STG and HG provided evidence that these areas represented the locations of two functionally separate fields. By stimulating HG electrically and recording from lateral STG sites, we obtained evidence that STG receives a short-latency input from HG. In addition, with a dense grid in place over the posterior lateral STG, we were able to show the spatial distribution of this corticocortical projection and its relationship to the EP map obtained with acoustic stimulation. Some of this work has been presented in abstract form Howard et al., 1997, 1998 . Intracranial electrodes A variety of electrodes were placed in cortical regions based on the clinical needs of the individual patient. With the dura mater reflected, and under direct visualization, one or more multicontact surface recording arrays Radion-ics, Inc., Burlington, MA were positioned to cover as much of the exposed surface of the lateral STG as possible. Frequently, electrode grids included parts of the adjacent parietal cortex and middle temporal gyrus. Surface record-ing arrays consisted of platinum-iridium disc electrodes embedded in a silicon membrane. The center-to-center spacing of the electrodes on a grid was 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, or 1 cm. The diameter of the electrodes was 4.7 mm for the 1-cm spaced electrodes and 3.7 mm for the others. The contact exposure on the 4.7-mm electrode was 2.5 mm, whereas that on the 3.7-mm electrode was 1.6 mm. The number of electrodes in an array was either 20 5 3 4 , 60 5 3 12 , or 64 8 3 8 . Strip electrodes with 1-cm spacing were also used in some subjects. In addition to the surface recording grids described above, modified depth electrodes Hybrid Depth Electrode HDE , Howard et al., 1996b were stereotactically im-planted into HG of the nonâspeech-dominant temporal lobe in five of the chronic patients. The HDE was oriented roughly parallel to the long axis of HG and was capable of recording electrical activity from as many as nine sites distributed over its length. Chronic recordings were ob-tained through grid and depth electrodes without compro-mising ongoing clinical EEG recordings. Intracranial re-cording and electrical-stimulation methods used in these studies were the same as those used routinely before or during epilepsy surgery to localize the focus of seizure onset and to identify functional areas of cortex. During recording sessions, the recording equipment and usually two or three experimenters were in the patientâs room patients were in a reclined position in a hospital bed. The room was kept as quiet as possible. Closed circuit televi-sion was also used to ensure that recordings were carried out while the patient appeared awake and alert. Five patients in this study with unambiguous evidence of a unilateral, well-localized temporal lobe seizure focus underwent craniotomy and temporal lobe resection under local anesthesia without the aid of chronic subdural EEG recording. Limited EEG recording and electrical stimula-tion mapping were carried out during the craniotomy procedure to aid in determining the location and limits of the resection. Anatomic imaging A three-dimensional reconstruction was performed on the brain of each patient based on preoperative thin, contiguous MR images by using Brainvox Damasio and Frank, 1992 Frank et al., 1997 . The thickness of the MRI slices varied between 1.5 and 1.8 mm. The in-plane resolution was 0.9 mm for subjects studied early in the series, and 0.7 mm for later subjects. On the basis of these three-dimensional 3D images HG was identified within the supratemporal plane. To provide information concern-ing the spatial relationship between HG which cannot be visualized directly from the cortical surface and PLST. Figure 1 illustrates a 3D MRI of a lateral surface top of a right cerebral hemisphere and of the superior temporal plane middle after overlying cortex was removed digi-tally to show the lateral projections of the posterior P and anterior A limits of the HG on the surface image of the STG. These landmarks are also shown in cross-sectional MRIs bottom . The red line drawn on the image of superior temporal plane middle also shows the trajectory of a HDE. Postimplantation MRIs were also obtained. The acquisition parameters were the same for the pre-and post-implantation images. The final locations of the depth and surface electrodes were determined by using the 3D MRI technique described above, together with detailed photographs of the exposed surface of the brain taken during the implantation procedure. This information was used to construct EP maps of each subject, including those presented in this study. In cases for which there were multiple HGs, the depth electrode always traversed the anterior of these, reaching its mesial portion where previous physiological and ana-tomic results indicate that AI resides. With a single multicontact electrode positioned within HG, it was not possible to obtain a comprehensive functional map of acoustically responsive regions throughout the gyrus or on surrounding areas on the superior temporal plane. Thus, we were unable to determine with certainty whether we recorded from field AI or from an adjoining auditory area. Although we tentatively conclude that our mesial depth recordings originated in areaAI, we leave open the possibil-ity that these recordings and those from more lateral recording sites were from acoustically active and cytoarchi-tectonically distinct fields that lie immediately adjacent to AI. Because of this uncertainty, we simply refer to our depth recording and stimulation as being within HG, which is interpreted to mean the mesial aspect of the anterior, or first, transverse temporal gyrus Rademacher et al., 1993 . Acoustic stimulation and EP recordings Brain potentials were amplified Bak Electronics, Ger-mantown, MD , filtered bandpass 2â500Hz , digitized 1 kHz sampling rate, DataWave, Longmont, CO , displayed on-line, and stored for off-line analysis.An electrode on the ventral surface of the ipsilateral temporal lobe served as the reference electrode. The filter settings and reference electrode placement were selected for optimal recording of low frequency waveforms originating from superior tempo-ral cortex. Typically, we recorded simultaneously from eight or 12 cortical sites and from each site averaged the results of 100 stimulus presentations. The acoustic stimu-lus was a train of acoustic transients consisting of five clicks with an interclick interval of 10 msec presented bilaterally by means of insert earphones Etymotic Re-search, Elk Grove Village, IL . The click bursts were presented every 2 seconds with slight variation in the interstimulus interval to reduce contributions of synchro-nous noise to the averaged EP. A stimulus with these parameters was particularly effective in evoking relatively high amplitude stable potentials and, thus, was used routinely for locating and mapping the boundaries of acoustically responsive cortex. Sounds were delivered at a comfortable suprathreshold level for each patient, which was typically 50 dB above the detection threshold for the click train stimulus. Threshold was estimated against the background sounds in the patientâs hospital room. For each stimulus presentation, 1 second of the waveform was digitized and a running average computed and displayed on-line. Electrical stimulation Constant-current bipolar electrical stimulation was ap-plied to adjacent grid or depth electrode sites by a Grass SD9 stimulator Astromed-Grass, Providence, RI or a computer-controlled stimulus generator custom built by the University of Iowa Department of Biomedical Engineer-ing. Current strengths were maintained below after-discharge threshold Ojemann and Engel, 1986 . Two stimulus paradigms were used, both by using charge-balanced square waves 0.2-msec duration . The aim of using the first paradigm was to identify by standard electrical-stimulation functional-mapping methods Oje-mann and Engel, 1986 those loci where stimulation evoked or altered an acoustic sensation or disrupted speech function. Here, the stimuli were pulse trains deliv-ered at a frequency of 50 Hz and current strengths of 4â10 mA. This clinical mapping technique is used widely by epilepsy surgeons to localize cortical regions that subserve speech, motor, and somatosensory functions to avoid dam-aging these sites during the resection procedure. The aim of using the second stimulus paradigm was to activate a localized area of cortex while recording from other cortical sites, thereby studying possible functional connections between cortical fields. In the present study, we focused on the possible functional connection between HG and the lateral surface of the STG. This experiment was carried out by delivering single electrical pulses to HG 1 or 2 second, 1â4 mA , while recording simultaneously from the electrode grid on the lateral STG. Thus, the spatial distribution of averaged EPs obtained by electrical stimu-lation was compared directly with the EP map obtained from the same grid with acoustical stimulation in the same subject. In addition, sites on STG were stimulated and recordings were made from the depth electrode in HG. In both experiments, the averaged waveform from 100 stimu-lus trials was computed and displayed on-line, as de-scribed above for acoustic stimulation. Electrical stimula-tion with these parameters is not perceived by the subject. It is a safe procedure that has been used previously to study functional connections between temporal lobe re-gions in neurosurgical patients Wilson et al., 1990 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Human subjects Research protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Human Subjects Review Board. Studies were carried out in patients undergoing surgical treatment for medi-cally intractable epilepsy. Presurgical electroencephalogra-phy EEG and brain-imaging data provided essential information about the location of the seizure focus before surgical resection. Informed consent was obtained after the nature and possible consequences of the studies were explained to the patient. Patients did not incur additional risk by participating in these studies. All patients under-went preoperative WADA testing to determine hemi-spheric speech dominance. Results of pure tone audiom-etry carried out before the start of these studies all fell within the normal range. Data presented in this study were derived from 13 patients in whom chronic electrodes were implanted for periods ranging from 2 to 17 days median, 13 days . Scalp recorded EEG failed to adequately define the location of the seizure focus in these patients thus, it was necessary for them to undergo a period of intracranial EEG monitor-ing and electrical-stimulation functional-mapping before resection surgery. The left hemisphere was studied in five of these patients and the right in eight. Five additional patients three left, two right hemisphere were studied in the operating room during a 30-minute EEG recording session preceding surgical resection. Of the total, seven-teen patients exhibited speech dominance in the left hemisphere and one R11, Table 1 had bilateral speech representation. DISCUSSION We have shown in the awake human subject that click trains of moderate intensity evoke a prominent polyphasic response that is confined to a limited area of the posterolat-eral superior temporal gyrus and is stable over days of recording. Based on sensitivity to stimulus rate and gen-eral anesthesia, the averaged EP recorded in STG can be differentiated from the averaged EP recorded simulta-neously from HG, the presumed site of the primary auditory field. The acoustically active STG area is repre-sented on both the left dominant and right cerebral hemispheres. We have no evidence that the EPs recorded on the lateral STG are the result of evoked activity volume conducted from HG see Lee et al., 1984 . Hence, we tentatively consider the area on the posterior aspect of STG that responded to click trains a single auditory area, which we refer to as the posterior lateral superior temporal auditory area PLST . The peak latencies of the averaged EP waveform were all within the range of those of the middle latency and late auditory or event-related potentials identified in magneto-encephalography MEG Hari, 1990 Pantev et al., 1995 and EEG Kraus and McGee, 1992 Pantev et al., 1995 recordings see also Goff, 1978 . Although our experiments were aimed primarily at auditory areas on the lateral STG, we also recorded from a limited number of sites in HG of five subjects. HG evoked potentials were characterized by a series of waves, beginning with a small short-latency peak. The polarity of the HG waves could differ across subjects, presumably because of the location of the record-ing site with respect to the source dipole. These observa-tions are in general agreement with others who have recorded in this area Celesia et al., 1968 Celesia and Puletti, 1969, 1971 Puletti and Celesia, 1970 Celesia, 1976 Lee et al., 1984 Liegeois-Chavel et al., 1991, 1994 . Induction of general anesthesia had a differential effect on the HG and PLST response. The early components of the EP recorded in HG of the awake subject were reduced in amplitude but clearly recognizable under anesthesia see also Lee et al., 1984 , whereas later components were severely attenuated or eliminated. Celesia and Puletti 1971 observed similar differences between HG evoked potentials recorded in awake patients and EPs recorded from the same area in a different population of patients under general anesthesia. Results similar to these were also obtained by Kral et al. 1999 from area AI of the cat. In contrast to the HG evoked potentials, we found that the PLST responses were eliminated by general anesthesia, in agreement with observations of Celesia and Puletti 1971 . These results are also consistent with earlier data of Woolsey 1971 showing the click response map in the anesthetized chimpanzee confined to the superior tempo-ral plane. They also agree with the findings in the monkey that under general anesthesia responsiveness of lateral superior temporal gyrus to clicks and tones is relatively poor compared with that of the primary field Pribram et al., 1954 Merzenich and Brugge, 1973 Rauschecker et al., 1995 Rauschecker, 1998a . General anesthesia has also been shown to eliminate preferentially the middle latency components of auditory-evoked potentials recorded from the scalp of awake humans Madler et al., 1991 , again pointing at PLST as one source of these waves. Libet et al. 1967 and Ray et al. 1999 have shown that, although the presence alone of an early EP in primary somatosensory cortex evoked by a peripheral stimulus is a necessary event for conscious awareness of the stimulus, it is not sufficient later waves, lasting several hundred millisec-onds must also be present. If the same situation obtains in auditory cortex then it would appear that general anesthe-sia preferentially attenuates or eliminates those later waves associated with conscious awareness of a sound. The systematic differences in the time course of recovery of EPs, derived from recordings made simultaneously in HG and lateral STG sites, provided additional evidence that these were two separate fields. As interstimulus intervals shortened, the amplitude of EPs recorded from PLST decreased to a much greater degree than EPs recorded from HG. The pattern of rate sensitivity we observed from our HG recordings was consistent with previous reports of direct recordings from HG in humans Puletti and Celesia, 1970, Celesia 1976, Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1991 and from AI in experimental animals see Litovsky et al., 1999 . Lee and colleagues 1984 recorded low amplitude short latency EPs from peri-Sylvian cortex by using a continu-ous train of clicks at 6.8 Hz 147-msec interclick interval . Our results indicate that such a stimulus would evoke from PLST either a very weak response or no response at all. The EPs they recorded from STG resembled those previously recorded directly from HG, were maintained under general anesthesia, and exhibited a frequency after response at a click rate of 40 Hz. These findings led the authors to conclude that responses they recorded on the STG represented EPs that were volume-conducted from HG. Although it is likely Lee et al. reached the correct conclusions from their results, our findings of clear differ-ences in sensitivity of HG and lateral STG to general anesthesia and to changes in rate of stimulation led us to conclude that we were recording from different cortical fields. Differences in the EP responses recorded from HG and PLST may result in part from differences in thalamic input to the two fields. If thalamocortical projections in the human forebrain are comparable to those in monkey reviewed by Kaas and Hackett, 1998 then human A1 would receive its main thalamic input from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body. In contrast, fields on the lateral aspect of the STG would receive their projections mainly from the dorsal and medial divisions of MGB and from the suprageniculate limitans and medial pulvinar nuclei. Following this line of reasoning, the mesial recording sites in HG would then occupy a portion of the ââauditory coreââ and PLST a portion of the ââauditory parabelt.ââ Our finding that PLST exhibits longer time constants than HG, and the fact that this area, in addition to having different thalamic inputs, receives projections from the primary field on HG, would suggest that PLST is engaged in further processing of these sound sequences having very long temporal intervals see also Phillips and Farmer, 1990 Griffiths et al., 1998 . We were able to obtain relatively detailed maps of the distributions of averaged EPs in single subjects with grid electrodes covering much of the posterior lateral STG. Celesia and his colleagues, after extensive recording in many subjects, reported two areas of acoustic-evoked potentials one on the supratemporal plane and another more extensive region around the Sylvian fissure on the lateral surface of the STG and the parietal lobe summa-rized by Celesia, 1976 . Without the benefit of modern recording grid arrays and brain imaging methods, they were unable to map systematically in a single subject the spatial extent of acoustically sensitive STG and to relate accurately the electrophysiological results to anatomic landmarks on the lateral surface of the STG and on the superior temporal plane. Moreover, without simultaneous recordings from HG and surrounding STG cortex, it would have been difficult to determine with certainty whether the recorded EPs were from the same or different fields. Our data show considerable intersubject variability in the distribution of EPs with respect to fissural patterns on the lateral STG. Similar differences in auditory maps across subjects have been recognized in animal experiments e.g., Merzenich and Brugge, 1973 Merzenich et al., 1975 . Indeed it may have been the pooling of data across many subjects that accounts for the relatively broad acoustically active region illustrated by Celesia 1976 on and around the STG. Amplitude gradients of PLST-evoked potentials, some quite steep, were observed on the lateral STG around a region or regions of high EP amplitude, providing addi-tional evidence that the neural sources for the response were located within the region of the gyrus directly beneath the recording contacts or in very close proximity to them. We have not mapped in detail the supratemporal plane and, therefore, must leave unanswered the question of whether and to what extent field PLST extends on to the superior surface of the STG. Liegeois-Chauvel et al. 1991, 1994 recorded auditory EPs by using multiple cylindrical penetrating depth electrodes stereotactically implanted along lateral-medial trajectories such that simultaneous recordings could be obtained from presumed A1 cortex mesial HG and immediately adjacent acoustically sensi-tive cortex planum temporale and lateral HG on the supratemporal plane. All of their patients were awake and studied outside the operating room. Although comparison between their results and ours is made difficult because of differences in acoustical stimuli and recording conditions, based on the latency of peaks and valleys in the EP, it would appear that the first positive deflection we recorded in PLST, with a peak latency between about 35 and 70 msec, spans the P50 peak they recorded from the lateral extension of HG or the planum temporale, whereas the second, negative, deflection is within the range of the N75 and N120 potentials Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1994 . Our preliminary results from depth recordings indicate that EPs recorded in lateral HG may differ from those in mesial HG. From earlier work Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1994 , it appears that there may be at least one other auditory field situated between PLST and HG, which would be consis-tent with the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of this part of the human temporal lobe. Results of MEG recordings indicate that activation of cortex in this region contributes to the 100 msec latency N1m component of the auditory-evoked response Lu Â¨tkenho Â¨ner and Steinstra Â¨ter, 1998 . Again extrapolating from data obtained in the monkey Kaas and Hackett, 1998 , we might consider this region part of the ââauditory belt,ââ lying between mesial HG ââauditory coreââ and PLST ââauditory parabeltââ . The observation that in some cases there were multiple foci of evoked activity suggests that area PLST may be subdivided or that it may represent more than one distinct cortical area. Given the localized nature of EP foci often found within PLST, it may also be possible that additional foci were overlooked when grids with comparatively large intercontact distances were used early in the series. PLST appears to correspond to a portion of Brodmannâs area 22. However, in the human, area 22 is not homogeneous in its cytoarchitecture and, thus, PLST may overlap substan-tially with several of the cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the STG described by later anatomists Economo, 1929 Hopf, 1964 Galaburda and Sanides, 1980 . In our human studies, it is not possible to correlate directly the bound-aries of physiological maps with the underlying cytoarchi-tecture. However, in the monkey the boundaries of mul-tiple auditory fields on the superior temporal gyrus defined electrophysiologically Merzenich and Brugge, 1973 Imig et al., 1977 Morel and Kaas, 1992 Morel et al., 1993 Rauschecker et al., 1995 Rauschecker, 1998a,b correlate well with the boundaries defined by the underlying cytoar-chitecture Burton and Jones, 1976 Pandya and Sanides, 1973 Hackett et al., 1998 . Thus, our conclusion that PLST is a single auditory area remains tentative until further studies are carried out. Such studies will include a wider range of acoustic stimuli, including speech sounds and greater attention to the behavioral state of the subject. While applying electrical stimulation to sites in HG, we recorded short-latency evoked responses in PLST. The stimuli were single short electrical pulses that did not evoke auditory sensations. This result suggests the exis-tence of a projection of HG upon PLST. Early neurophysi-ological studies of the temporal auditory fields in the chimpanzee Bailey et al., 1943 and rhesus monkey Ward et al., 1946 Sugar et al., 1948 showed that when strych-nine was applied to primary auditory cortex, spikes were profusely propagated into area 22. Later electrophysiologi-cal Bignall, 1969 and anatomic Kaas and Hackett, 1998 Hackett et al., 1998 results have confirmed and elabo-rated upon these and other auditory corticocortical connec-tions in the nonhuman primate. Liegeois-Chauvel et al. 1991 applied single shocks to the dorsoposterior region of HG in a human patient and elicited evoked responses with a 6â8-msec latency on the lateral aspect of HG itself, suggesting a polysynaptic corticocortical projection to this area. In our studies, short latency potentials were ob-served over a region of lateral STG that overlapped PLST, thus revealing for the first time in the human a functional connection between these two auditory fields. We were unable to ascertain whether this is a direct connection between the two areas or an indirect one, the latter being consistent with the hierarchical connectivity model of Kaas and Hackett 1998 based on extensive electrophysi-ological mapping and neuroanatomic tracer studies in the monkey. The EP elicited by electrical stimulation had an onset latency in the order of several milliseconds and, at the highest stimulus levels used, exhibited dual negative peaks, which suggests that the PLST was activated over a polysynaptic pathway from HG. That such a connection can be demonstrated between HG and PLST also lends further credence to our interpretation of PLST being a field distinct from HG. Griffiths et al. 1998 have suggested that such circuitry may be involved in emergent temporal properties of cortical processing. When pulse trains of electrical stimuli were delivered at the focus of maximal response within PLST, the subjects reported hearing sounds or experiencing a change in their perception of ambient sounds. The nature of these percep-tions was similar to the auditory responses or crude auditory sensations described by 16% of Penfieldâs patients after electrical stimulation of the lateral STG or HG Penfield and Jasper, 1954 . Evoked percepts were always reported as being heard at the contralateral ear. Sites in the language-dominant hemisphere evoking auditory per-ceptions did not colocalize with sites causing speech arrest findings that are consistent with those of Penfield. None of our patients described auditory ââexperientialââresponses or hallucinations of things previously heard, as Penfield observed in 2.1% of his patients after electrical stimulation of the lateral STG Penfield and Perot, 1963 . Current evidence would suggest that experiential responses do not occur after electrical stimulation of cortex unless activity is propagated to limbic structures Gloor et al., 1982 . In our series, techniques were available, and care was taken, not to induce after-discharges that could result in propaga-tion of epileptiform activity to mesial structures. Whereas direct stimulation of PLST sites with a 50 Hz train of electrical pulses resulted in conscious perception of sound, activation of these same sites by a single electrical pulse, either directly or indirectly by means of a corticocor-tical projection from HG, failed to do so. These observa-tions are consistent with the results of direct electrical stimulation of somatic sensory Libet et al., 1964 Ray et al., 1999 or visual cortex Ray et al., 1999 , namely that a relatively long ââutilization train duration or utilization timeââ Libet et al., 1964 is necessary to produce a sensory experience. There is growing evidence from modern functional brain imaging studies in humans Petersen et al., 1988 Binder et al., 1994, 1997 Fiez et al., 1995 that the STG may be made up of multiple functional areas, each engaged in different aspects of complex acoustic processing. Increases in cerebral blood flow associated with perceptual analysis of speech Petersen et al., 1988 Binder, 1995 Fiez et al., 1995, 1996 Price et al., 1996 Zatorre et al., 1996a Binder et al., 1997 with melodic patterns Griffiths et al., 1998 , or with acoustic imagery Zatorre et al., 1996b , have been reported in an area that appears to overlap field PLST. Electrophysiological recordings in the rhesus monkey Rauschecker et al., 1995 Rauschecker, 1998a,b and in the human Ojemann and Engel, 1986 Creutzfeldt et al., 1987 Ojemann et al., 1988 Steinschneider et al., 1999 are in general accord with the human functional imaging findings that the lateral STG is involved in processing complex acoustic signals, including speech. The data pre-sented in this study were obtained by using click-train stimulation. This approach was a necessary first step in identifying and mapping the extent of acoustic cortex in the lateral temporal lobe in human. Further studies that use more complex signals, including speech sounds, are presently under way. Furthermore, although averaged acoustic-evoked potentials reveal the presence of acoustic input to the cortex, they fail to show the moment-by-moment changes in excitability that may occur in naive awake subjects. Despite these limitations, the data pre-sented provide direct evidence of an auditory association cortical area on STG and add to our emerging understand- ing of an organizational framework for human auditory cortex, which is a necessary step for discerning its func-tional role s in hearing and speech perception. RESULTS Features of the averaged evoked potential In each of 13 patients with chronically implanted elec-trode arrays, click trains elicited EPs from only a limited area along the lateral surface of the posterior STG Figs. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 . We refer to this area on the STG as the posterior lateral superior temporal field, or PLST see Discussion section . Typically, there was one electrode site at which the peak-to-peak amplitude of the EP was maximal the amplitude of the EP decreased more or less abruptly around this site Figs. 5, 10 . In five cases, there was evidence for a second focus of EP activity Figs. 6, 9 , and in one case a possible third Fig. 7 . Figure 2 illustrates five superimposed averaged EPs recorded under the same stimulus conditions from the Subject Pa Na Pb Nb same STG site on five successive occasions over a period of 6 days. The EPs show both the time structure of the waveform and its variability over days of recording. The EP was characterized by an initial positive peak Pa followed by a negative component Na and then by addi-tional positive Pb and negative waves Nb of smaller amplitude. We use this notation for the waveform peaks to distinguish between auditory EPs recorded directly from the brain and those recorded from the scalp by others see Kraus and McGee, 1992 . Table 1 lists for each subject in this study the latencies of major peaks in the EP recorded at the site of maximal response. As can be seen from these latency measurements as well as from the waveforms on the EP maps, the major components of the averaged EP illustrated in Figure 2 were identified across subjects, although the latency and relative amplitudes of the peaks could vary across electrode sites in any one subject and among subjects. Because of surgical time constraints, long-term response variability in the EP could not be studied in intraoperative cases. The averaged EPs recorded from HG depth electrodes were similar in shape across recording sites in the same subject but, unlike those recorded in STG, could differ markedly between subjects, as can be seen by comparing the waveforms in Figure 3a,c. We attribute this intersub-ject difference in HG waveform to the likelihood that across subjects the recordings were made in different cortical layers. Earlier studies noted similar intersubject differences in the polarity of the polyphasic waveforms recorded from HG, which were attributed to the recording electrode being placed on different sides of the generating dipole Celesia and Puletti, 1969 Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1991 see also Steinschneider et al., 1992 . Although our postimplantation MRIs revealed clearly each of the elec-trode contacts within the cortical gray matter, this method did not provide sufficient resolution to determine the laminar distribution of recording sites. We sought further evidence that EPs recorded in HG and STG were derived from different fields of auditory cortex. We obtained simultaneous recordings from sites on both HG and STG while acoustic stimuli with different interstimulus intervals were presented Fig. 3 . The HG recordings were from the mesial electrode sites, presum-ably in primary auditory cortex. The PLST recordings were from the sites at or near where EP amplitude was greatest in response to click-train stimulation. PLST recov-ery functions tended to be similar to each other but, at short interstimulus intervals, were clearly separable from those derived from HG recordings. In both subjects, at the shortest interstimulus intervals, there was a marked difference in the amplitudes of the EPs at the HG and PLST sites. As interstimulus interval lengthened, the amplitudes of the EPs at the two sites increased, converg-ing at the control interstimulus interval of 2 seconds. We also were able to study in three cases the EPs recorded simultaneously at both the HG and STG sites before and just after induction of general anesthesia. Figure 4 illus-trates the general finding that the entire EP recorded in PLST was abolished within approximately 3 minutes of induction of general anesthesia. In HG, only the later components of the EP were reduced or abolished, leaving the early negative component attenuated in amplitude but otherwise largely intact. Distribution of STG averaged evoked potentials The distribution of averaged EPs was plotted for each patient. These results were then aligned with the sulcal landmarks aided by 3D MRI reconstructions e.g., Fig. 1 and intraoperative photographs. The five EP maps pre-sented in this study illustrate that some map features were consistent across subjects and that other features varied. Figure 5 illustrates a map obtained from the left dominant hemisphere of one subject maps shown in Figures 6, 7, 9, and 10 were obtained from the right nondominant hemispheres of four additional subjects. The position of the electrode array s varied from one subject to the next but usually included most of the posterior portion of the STG shown by the shaded area on the MRIs and often a segment of the middle temporal gyrus ventrally and parietal cortex dorsally. In all 18 cases, there was at least one area on the posterior STG where the amplitude of the auditory EP was greatest, with EP amplitude falling off with distance from that focus of maximum amplitude. Figures 5 and 10 illustrate cases for which a single prominent EP focus of activity was found within the boundary of the grid. In other subjects, there were clearly two areas of EP activity, which were separated by a region in which there was little or no auditory-evoked activity in evidence Figs. 6, 9 . In one case, a possible third focus of activity was observed Fig. 7 . The sizes of the areas in which EPs were recorded varied from subject to subject, with the maps in Figures 7c and 9c showing the two extremes. In some e.g., Fig. 7 , we may have only recorded from a portion of a posterior EP focus because it fell close to the grid border. From examina- tion of all the maps obtained with click-train stimulation, we estimate that an acoustically responsive zone could extend up to several centimeters rostrocaudally and dorso-ventrally on the posterior STG. It also seemed clear that the areas of highest amplitude EP were located dorsally on the STG and in some cases quite close to the crown of the gyrus. In several cases e.g., Figs. 7, 10 , EPs on posterior STG were recorded from electrodes that appeared to make contact with the dorsal lip of the lateral fissure, although it is more likely that they were over the pia mater that spans the fissure. We interpret these EPs as arising from the ventral lip of the lateral fissure on the STG. There was also a relatively consistent spatial relationship between the area of EPs on the STG and the lateral boundaries of HG and planum temporale. Figure 11 illustrates the estimated location and extent of PLST. The extent to which the waveform of the EPs or the boundaries of the auditory responsive area on STG might change with changes in stimulus parameters is not known. Changing stimulus intensity can alter the latencies and amplitudes of the EP peaks and valleys. Evoked responses to tone bursts and noise bursts were recorded in the same area from which we recorded click-evoked potentials, but we did not obtain sufficient data to determine their full extent or the degree of overlap. Although electrode grids were often placed all along the STG, clear EPs to click trains were not elicited from the anterior portion of the gyrus. EPs were often recorded on the parietal cortex postcentral and supramarginal gyri at sites distant from the EP areas on the STG, as shown by the recordings from the most dorsal row of electrode sites in Figure 7. We also recorded EPs from electrodes on the inferior frontal gyrus. We have no evidence for auditory-evoked activity on the middle temporal gyrus. The details of recordings beyond the temporal lobe are outside the scope of this study. Although EP maps were recorded from posterior STG of both the left dominant and right nondominant hemi-spheres, we did not record from the left and right hemi-spheres in the same subject and our sample size is not adequate to determine the extent to which there may be systematic differences in EP maps or EP waveforms re-lated to laterality of recording. Evidence for a connection between HG and STG We stimulated the HG site from which the highest amplitude auditory EP was obtained while recording from STG sites previously mapped by auditory stimulation Fig. 8 . The locations of the bipolar pairs of stimulating elec-trodes in HG and the sites of recording of the EPs are shown in the insets of Figures 9 and 10. The EPs exhibited an initial surface-positive peak for electrical stimuli just above threshold as stimulus strength was raised, the EP became biphasic with a prominent dual-peak negative component emerging at higher stimulus levels. The peaks were about 10 msec apart. Onset latency was selected as the time at which the waveform first demonstrated a clear deflection from baseline. The shortest onset latencies measured ranged from 2.5 to 3.0 msec. Earlier compo-nents, if they existed, would have been obscured by the stimulus artifact. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate for two subjects the spatial distribution of averaged EPs on the STG elicited by electrical stimulation and its relationship to the spatial distribution of averaged EPs evoked by click trains. In the acoustic EP map of Figure 9c, two EP foci were found, whereas the map shown in Figure 10c exhibits a single focus of activity. Figures 9d and 10d show that the distribution of EPs on the STG resulting from electrical stimulation of HG overlapped the map of auditory EPs obtained in the same subjects. In subject R16 Fig. 9 , the EPs having the maximal amplitude to electrical or acoustic stimulation were recorded at the same STG electrode site asterisks , although the EP map obtained by HG electrical stimulation was more extensive than that obtained by acoustic stimulation. The map obtained in patient R32 Fig. 10 by using electrical stimulation was also extensive, with the largest EP occurring near the site of the maximal response to acoustic stimulation. However, in this case, the stimulus artifact obscured some of the details of the EP waveform, especially along the three most rostral rows of electrodes. Preliminary analysis of data obtained while stimulating acoustically active sites within PLST and recording from HG suggests the existence of reciprocal connections between these two fields. Studies of the pos-sible functional relationships between STG and HG are ongoing. Sensations evoked by electrical stimulation of STG During the course of clinical electrical stimulation map-ping, a number of auditory sensations were evoked that were similar to those reported by Penfield Penfield and Perot, 1963 . Electrically stimulating the site of maximal EP evoked by clicks in PLST elicited in all chronic patients either auditory percepts e.g., ââswooshing of jumping rope,ââ ââwhining,ââ ââjet engine,ââ etc , or an alteration in the percep-tion of sound in their environment Fig. 11 . No patients reported hearing human speech, voices, or music. In left hemisphere cases, electrical stimulation of the STG focus of maximal response did not disrupt patientsâ abilities to count, name objects, follow verbal commands, or generate meaningful spontaneous speech, although disruption of naming was noted at other left posterior temporal lobe sites.

Comp.

It plays a critical role in the functioning of the striatum as it is the transmitter of projection neurons and sub-populations of interneurons, as well as afferents from the globus pallidus. Some of the factors controlling GABA transmission are the type(s) of GABA receptor expressed at the site of transmission, their subunit composition, and their location in relation to GABA release sites. To address these issues, we examined the sub-cellular localization of subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in the striatum of the rat. Sections of freeze-substituted, Lowicryl-embedded striatum were immunolabelled by the post-embedding immunogold technique with antibodies specific for subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. Immunolabelling for alpha1, beta2/3, and gamma2 GABA(A) receptor subunits was primarily located at symmetrical synapses on perikarya, dendrites, and spines. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of immunolabelling for the beta2/3 subunits revealed that the majority of membrane associated immunogold particles were at synapses and that, on average for the whole population, they were evenly distributed across the synapse. Double labelling for the beta2/3 subunits and for GABA itself revealed that receptor-positive synapses were formed by at least two populations of terminals. One population (59.3%) of terminals forming receptor-positive synapses was positive for GABA, whereas the other (40.7%) had low or undetectable levels of GABA.

It plays a critical role in the functioning of the striatum as it is the transmitter of projection neurons and sub-populations of interneurons, as well as afferents from the globus pallidus. Some of the factors controlling GABA transmission are the type s of GABA receptor expressed at the site of transmission, their subunit composition, and their location in relation to GABA release sites. To address these issues, we examined the sub-cellular localization of subunits of the GABAA receptor in the striatum of the rat. Sections of freeze-substituted, Lowicryl-embedded striatum were immunolabelled by the post-embedding immunogold technique with antibodies specific for subunits of the GABAA receptor. Immunolabelling for a1, b2 3, and g2 GABAA receptor subunits was primarily located at symmetrical synapses on perikarya, dendrites, and spines. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of immunolabelling for the b2 3 subunits revealed that the majority of membrane associated immunogold particles were at synapses and that, on average for the whole population, they were evenly distributed across the synapse. Double labelling for the b2 3 subunits and for GABA itself revealed that receptor-positive synapses were formed by at least two populations of terminals. One population 59.3% of terminals forming receptor-positive synapses was positive for GABA, whereas the other 40.7% had low or undetectable levels of GABA. Furthermore, the post-synaptic neurons were characterised on neurochemical and morphological grounds as both medium spiny neurons and GABA interneurons. Triple immunolabelling revealed the co-localization of a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits at some symmetrical axodendritic synapse. It is concluded that fast GABAA-mediated transmission occurs primarily at symmetrical synapses within the striatum, that the populations of boutons giving rise to receptor-positive synapses are heterogeneous, and that previously reported co-existence of different subunits of the GABAA receptor at the cellular level also occurs at the level of individual synapses. J. Comp. Neurol. 416 158â172, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The inhibitory amino acid g-aminobutyric acid GABA plays a critical role in the neuronal networks of the basal ganglia. Most of the major classes of neurons in the basal ganglia utilize GABA as a neurotransmitter. Within the striatum, medium size densely spiny neurons, which are the major projection neurons of the striatum and give rise to extensive local axon collaterals, are GABAergic Smith and Bolam, 1990 . The striatum also contains populations of GABAergic interneurons Bolam et al., 1983, 1985 that express different calcium binding proteins Cowan et al., 1990 Kita et al., 1990 Kubota et al., 1993 Clarke and Bolam, 1997 or synthesize nitric oxide Kubota et al., 1993 . Furthermore, the striatum receives GABAergic afferents from the globus pallidus Bevan et al., 1998 Smith et al., 1998 and possibly the substantia nigra van der Kooy et al., 1981 . The effects of GABA are mediated by three sub-populations of GABA receptors, the ionotropic GABAA and GABAC receptors and the metabotropic GABAB receptors. Most of the effects in the striatum are mediated through GABAA receptors, which cause an increase in Cl2 conduc-tance that underlies early inhibitory postsynaptic poten-tials. Molecular studies have identified that the GABAA receptor, in keeping with other ionotropic receptors, con-sists of a combination of receptor subunits in a pentameric structure Backus et al., 1993 Smith and Olsen, 1995 Stephenson, 1995 McKernan and Whiting, 1996 . At least 15 subunits have been identified and, on the basis of both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, the most frequently occurring combination of subunits in the rat brain is a1, b2 3, and g2 Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 McKernan and Whiting, 1996 . Recent reports suggest that different cell types in the same brain area may contain distinct complements of subunits Persohn et al., 1992 Wisden et al., 1992 Gao et al., 1993 Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 Gao et al., 1995 that give rise to different pharmacological profiles McKernan et al., 1991 Smith and Olsen, 1995 Stephenson, 1995 and may mediate different forms of inhibition Brickley et al., 1996 Wall and Usowicz, 1997 . Furthermore, differential localization of GABA receptor subunits in relation to synaptic specializa-tions has been proposed to underlie phasic and tonic inhibition in the cerebellum Nusser et al., 1998 . In situ hybridization studies have identified a variety of GABAA receptor subunits in the striatum Zhang et al., 1991 Araki et al., 1992 Persohn et al., 1992 Wisden et al., 1992 Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 . Immunocytochemical studies using antibodies that recognize different subunits of the GABAA receptor have identified a, b, and g subunits that are differentially distributed within the striatum. For instance, several small sub-populations of morphologically distinct striatal neurons are strongly immunoreactive for a1 subunits, whereas antibodies against a2 or b2 3 sub-units label larger populations of neurons that are widely distributed in the striatum Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 Hartig et al., 1995 Caruncho et al., 1996, 1997 Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 Riedel et al., 1998 . The a1 subunit-positive neurons also express b2 3 and g2 subunits and glutamate decarboxylase and are thus GABAergic. Two of the populations have light and electron microscopic fea-tures of interneurons, whereas the third is similar in morphology and neurochemistry to a type of projection neuron Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 Riedel et al., 1998 that probably represents ectopic pallidal neurons Bolam et al., 1981, 1985 Penny et al., 1988 Bennett and Bolam, 1994a . Electron microscopic analysis of the a1 and b2 3 subunit-immunolabelled tissue in rat and baboon has revealed the presence of receptor-positive synapses of the symmetrical type associated with the immunoreactive neurons Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 . In addition, recep-tor immunolabelling was also detected at asymmetrical synapses, ie, the type usually associated with excitatory transmission, and it was also detected at non-synaptic sites Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 . These analyses were carried out using immunoperoxidase techniques to define antigenic sites precisely at the subcellular or subsynaptic level, it is necessary to compliment this approach with immu-nolabelling techniques in which the antigenic sites are identi-fied by non-diffusible markers Baude et al., 1993, 1994 Nusser et al., 1994 Ottersen and Landsend, 1997 . In view of the widespread distribution of GABA and its receptors in the striatum and its critical role in the function in the striatum, and the basal ganglia in general, it is important to characterise the position and composi-tion of GABA receptors in relation to the synaptic circuitry of the striatum. In this study we examine the localization of subunits of the GABAA receptor in the striatum of the rat. The primary objectives were threefold first, to deter-mine the sub-cellular localization of subunits of the GABAA receptor, in particular to determine their spatial relation-ship to synaptic specializations second, to attempt to characterize the axon terminals presynaptic to the GABAA receptor-positive synapses by GABAimmunolabelling and third, to determine whether different subunits of the GABAA receptor that have been shown to be co-expressed at the cellular level are co-expressed at individual synapses. These issues were addressed by using the post-embedding immuno-gold technique on freeze-substituted tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of tissue The tissue was obtained from four female Wistar rats Charles River, Margate, Kent 200â250 g maintained on a 12 hour light 12 hour dark cycle with free access to food and water. Environmental conditions for housing of the rats, and all procedures that were performed on them, were in accordance with the Animals Scientific Proce-dures Act 1986 and also the European Communities Council Directive 80 609 EEC . The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbitone Sagatal, 200 mg kg Rho Ëne Me Â´rieux, Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland and then perfused through the heart with 100 ml phosphate-buffered saline PBS 0.01 M phosphate, pH 7.4 or saline 0.9% NaCl over 1â2 minutes and then with 300 ml of 0.025â0.5% glutaraldehyde and 3% paraformal-dehyde with or without 0.2% picric acid , made up in phosphate buffer PB 0.1 M, pH 7.4 , over a period of 20 minutes. Following fixation, the brain was removed from the cranium, divided into 5-mm-thick coronal slices, and stored in PBS at 4Â°C prior to further processing. From each 5-mm slice, coronal sections 500 Î¼m through the stria-tum were taken by using a vibrating microtome. The sections were collected and washed several times in PBS. Freeze-substitution and Lowicryl embedding Asimilar procedure was used as described earlier Baude et al., 1993 . Small blocks of the striatum were trimmed from the 500-Î¼m sections. After washing in PB, they were placed in 0.5 M sucrose in PB for 15 minutes followed by 1 M sucrose in PB for 2 hours for cryoprotection. They were slammed on a polished copper block cooled with liquid nitrogen Reichert MM80E . The slammed blocks of tissue were transferred to a Leica CS Auto at 290Â°C where freeze-substitution and embedding in Lowicryl HM20 Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK was carried out as described before Clarke and Bolam, 1998 . Once the resin was polymerized and the blocks elevated to room temperature, they were removed for trimming and sectioning. Ultrathin sections 70 nm were cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut-E ultramicrotome and collected on gold or nickel single-slot grids coated with pioloform Agar Scientific or on adhesive-coated Coat-quick ââGââ medium Daido Sangyo, Japan gold or nickel mesh grids. Post-embedding immunogold labelling The sections were then immunolabelled by the post-embedding immunogold method essentially as described previously Nusser et al., 1998 . Briefly, the sections were treated with a saturated solution of sodium ethanolate for 3 seconds and washed in deionized water and then in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.9% NaCl TBS . They were then incubated for 30 minutes in 2% human serum albumin HSA in TBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 TBST followed by an overnight incubation in the primary antibody solutions diluted in TBST containing 2% HSA directed against subunits of the GABAA receptor, or against GABA itself, or incubated in mixtures of antibodies see below and Table 1 . They were then washed in TBS and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibodies conju-gated to colloidal gold 5â20 nm diameter all obtained from British BioCell, Cardiff, UK in 2% HSA in TBST supplemented with 5 mg ml polyethylene glycol for about 2 hours. They were washed in TBS, incubated in 2% glutar-aldehyde in TBS for 2 minutes, contrasted in 1% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined in a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope. In double-labelling and triple-labelling experiments, mixtures of primary antibodies against GABAand the b2 3 subunits of the GABAA receptor or antibodies against different subunits of the GABAA receptor were applied to the sections. In these experiments the species of origin of the primary antibodies were different. The following double-labelling and triple-labelling combinations were per-formed 1. Rabbit antibodies against GABA 1 5,000 Table 1 and mouse monoclonal antibodies against the b2 3 sub-units of the GABAA receptor 10 Î¼g ml Chemicon, Harrow, UK Table 1 . After washes they were incubated in a mixture of goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 15-1 60 or 20-nm 1 80 gold particles and goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to 10-nm gold particles 1 50 . 2. Rabbit antibodies against the a1 subunit 11 Î¼g ml Table 1 , mouse monoclonal antibodies against the b2 3 subunits of the GABAA receptor 10 Î¼g ml Table 1 , and guinea pig antibodies against the g2 subunit 10 Î¼g ml Table 1 overnight. The secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 20-nm gold particles 1 60 , goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to 10-nm gold particles 1 50 , and goat anti-guinea pig IgG coupled to 5-nm gold particles 1 40 . Antibody preparations Three antibodies were used in this study 1. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes extracellular domains on both the b2 and b3 subunits of the GABAA receptor. This antibody has been extensively character-ized Ha Â¨rtig et al., 1985 Schoch et al., 1985 Ewart et al., 1990 and used extensively in immunocytochemical studies see for instance Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 Somogyi et al., 1996 Waldvogel et al., 1998 . 2. A polyclonal antibody raised in guinea pigs against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 1â29 amino acids of the rat g2 subunit that was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Detailed characterization of the antibody has been described elsewhere Benke et al., 1996 Somogyi et al., 1996 . 3. A rabbit antibody raised against the N-terminal 1â14 amino acids of the rat a1 subunit. Affinity-purified anti-a1 1â14 Cys peptide antibodies were prepared following the method of Stephenson and Duggan 1991 . The peptide QPSQDELKDNTTVFC, which corresponds to the rat GABAA receptor a1 1â14 subunit sequence with a C-terminal cysteine was coupled to the carrier protein, thyroglobulin, via the m-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester method. Rabbits were in-jected with the peptide-carrier conjugate emulsified with Freundâs complete adjuvant at two sites intramus-cularly 0.1 Î¼mol peptide site . Subsequent immuniza-tions were in Freundâs incomplete adjuvant again at two sites intramuscularly. Animals were ear bled at 7 days following the second and subsequent immuniza-tions. The anti-a1 1â14 Cys peptide antibodies were affinity-purified by a1 1â14 Cys peptide affinity chroma-tography where the peptide was coupled to Activated Thiol Sepharose 4B via the terminal cysteine. Affinity-purified antibodies were stored at 4Â°C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3 until use. The specificity of the affinity-purified anti-a1 1â14 Cys antibodies were assessed by immunoblots Fig. 1 . Analysis of material The immunolabeled sections were examined in a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope. Immunoreactive sites were identified by the presence of the colloidal gold particles that were attached to the secondary antibodies. The distribution of immunogold particles coding for the b2 3 subunits was determined by systematic examination of adjacent photomicrographs at a final magnification of 33,000 366 gold particles 138 Î¼m2 or by systematic non-overlapping scans of sections on mesh grids 2,760 gold particles approximate area 8,980 Î¼m2 . The location of each gold particle was noted. To determine the associa-tion between GABAergic terminals and b2 3 subunits adjacent photomicrographs area 2,723 Î¼m2 were exam-ined or systematic, non-overlapping, scans of sections on mesh grids approximate area 7,480 Î¼m2 were made. A synapse was considered positive by the presence of two or more immunogold particles along the synaptic mem-branes. Each receptor-positive synapse and the level of immunogold labelling for GABA in the presynaptic bouton was assessed. A bouton was considered to be GABA negative or to have low levels of GABA if the number of gold particles was two or less. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of immunogold particles for the b2 3 subunits along the synaptic mem-brane specialization of striatal synapses was performed on electron micrographs. A total of 155 b2 3 subunit-positive synapses 746 gold particles from two animals were analyzed. All synapses in series of adjacent photomicro- graphs of well-preserved strips of ultrathin sections were analysed. In addition, micrographs containing synapses that had been selected for other parts of the current study were also analysed. Since the data from the random and non-random analyses were essentially similar, they were pooled. The distance of each immunoparticle from the nearest edge of the synapse was measured and normalised to take into account different widths of synapses. The data were expressed as the proportion of immunoparticles in five bins along the half width of the synapse see Bernard et al., 1997 Clarke and Bolam, 1998 . Quantification of the proportion of receptor-positive synapses that express immunoreactivity for a1, b2 3 and g2 subunits was performed by photographing every immu-nopositive synapse in well-preserved strips of an ultrathin section. Micrographs were printed at a final magnification of 33,000. The gold particles for a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits were counted on 50 synapses. The proportions of receptor-positive synapses expressing the different subunits were calculated. Controls In these experiments primary antibodies raised in three species mouse, guinea pig, and rabbit and goat secondary antibodies against immunoglobulins of the three species were used. Since double and triple labelling was per-formed, it is necessary to control for the specificity of the secondary antibodies. Sections were incubated with a mixture of two primary antibodies from different species, at the appropriate dilutions, and then with secondary, gold-conjugated antibody directed against immunoglobu-lins of the third species. In the same immunolabelling run, positive controls for each antibody were included. In each case the inappropriate gold-conjugated secondary anti-body failed to produce specific labelling, although the positive controls revealed specific labelling of symmetrical synapses and membranes in the case of the antibodies against receptor subunits, or intracellular labelling of cellular elements in the case of the antibodies against DISCUSSION The results of the present study provide a detailed analysis of the distribution of subunits of the GABAA receptor in relation to synaptic specializations in the striatum of the rat. They demonstrate first that subunits of the GABAA receptor are widely distributed in the striatum, that most of the immunolabelling is associated with the plasma membrane, and that almost half of this is associated with symmetrical synaptic specializations. The labelling for the b2 3 subunits, when considered as an average of the whole population, is evenly distributed across the synaptic specialization. Second, the receptor-positive synapses are heterogeneous with respect to both the pre-and post-synaptic structures. The post-synaptic neurons included medium spiny neurons, identified on the basis of morphological characteristics, and GABAinterneu-rons, identified on the basis of both morphological and neurochemical characteristics Bolam and Bennett, 1995 Kawaguchi et al., 1995 . About 60% of the pre-synaptic boutons forming b2 3 subunit-positive synapses are GABA-positive the remainder are formed by boutons that have low or undetectable levels of GABA. Finally, the present results demonstrate the colocalization of a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits of the GABAA receptor at individual symmetrical synapses. These findings suggest therefore that fast GABA transmission mediated by GABAA receptors containing a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits occurs primarily at synapses within the striatum, that the boutons giving rise to receptor-positive synapses are neurochemically heterogeneous, and that previously reported co-existence of different subunits of the GABAA receptor at the cellular level also occurs at the level of individual synapses. Subcellular distribution of GABAA receptor subunit immunolabelling The present findings demonstrate that there is a selec-tive association of immunogold particles coding for sub-units of the GABAA receptor with symmetrical synapses in the striatum. Although data is not available for the striatum, it has been estimated that in the hippocampus only 1â2% of neuronal membrane is occupied by asymmet-ric synapses and that the area of membrane occupied by symmetrical synapses is negligible Rusakov et al., 1998 . In the striatum about one-fifth of synapses are of the symmetrical type Ingham et al., 1998 . If the overall proportion of membrane occupied by synapses in the striatum is similar to that in the hippocampus, then 0.2â0.4% of neuronal membrane is occupied by symmetri-cal synapses. The finding of about 25% of total gold particles associated with symmetrical synapses represents a 125â250-fold enrichment at synapses. When considering the number of gold particles at synapses as a proportion of membrane-associated particles, then our results reveal a 220â440-fold enrichment at synapses. These findings are consistent with those observed in other regions of the brain including the globus pallidus, cerebellum, and hippocam-pus, where at least some of the subunits of the GABAA receptor are preferentially localized at synapses Nusser et al., 1995a,b, 1996a,b, 1997, 1998 Somogyi et al., 1996 Nusser and Somogyi, 1997 but see below . Furthermore, it seems to be a general principle that subunits of fast ionotropic receptors are preferentially localized at syn-apses, as ionotropic glutamate receptors both AMPA and NMDA in the basal ganglia Bernard et al., 1997 Bernard and Bolam, 1998 Clarke and Bolam, 1998 as well as in other regions of the brain Baude et al., 1994, 1995 Nusser et al., 1994 Kharazia et al., 1996 Kharazia and Weinberg, 1997 Ottersen and Landsend, 1997 Popratiloff et al., 1998 are selectively associated with synapses whereas at least some metabotropic receptors are preferentially lo-cated at perisynaptic sites Baude et al., 1993 Lujan et al., 1996 Ottersen and Landsend, 1997 . The nature of the immunolabelling outside of synapses or at intracellular sites remains to be established. The membrane-associated receptors may represent true ââextrasynaptic receptorsââ that will only be exposed to GABA that has diffused from the release site in the synapse alternatively, they may be non-functional or receptors that are in the process of being transported to the synapse. Similarly, intracellular label may represent receptors undergoing synthesis, transport, degradation, or recycling. The detection of immunolabelling at symmetrical syn-apses is consistent with previous findings in the rat and baboon Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 . However, in these studies the postsynaptic density of some asymmetrical synapses were reported to be immunopositive for a1 and b2 3 subunits, an observation not made in the present study. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is technical, relating to the techniques that were used. It is well recognised that peroxidase reaction products are diffusible and readily adhere to membranes and to post-synaptic densities and can thus give false-positive label-ling. Colloidal gold when attached to the secondary anti-body does not diffuse. Thus the detection of labelling only at symmetrical synapses is probably a reflection of the true distribution of immunolabelling. It should be noted, how-ever, that post-embedding labelling on freeze-substituted tissue is less sensitive that other methods it may be that the level of receptor subunits at asymmetric synapses as well as at other sites is below the detection limit of the technique Baude et al., 1994 Nusser et al., 1994 . Never-theless, our findings indicate that the highest concentra-tion or density of GABAA receptor subunits occurs at symmetrical synapses. The quantitative analysis revealed that, when consid-ered as a population, immunolabeling for the b2 3 sub-units of the GABAA receptor was evenly distributed across the width of the synapse. Labelling became negligible within a few nanometers of the edge of the synaptic specialization. This indicates that GABA transmission mediated through GABAA receptors that possess b2 and or b3 subunits is likely to occur almost exclusively within the synapse and that there is a homogeneous distribution of receptors in the post-synaptic membrane. These findings are consistent with previous findings of the distribution of GABAA receptors subunits in the hippocampus Nusser et al., 1995a, 1996a and subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the striatum Bernard et al., 1997 Bernard and Bolam, 1998 , entopeduncular nucleus, and subtha-lamic nucleus Clarke and Bolam, 1998 . It must be noted, however, that GABAergic synapses in the striatum are heterogeneous with respect to their origin the average data that we generated may obscure any variations in the distribution of immunolabelling at sub-populations of syn-apses. It is not possible to determine whether immunogold labelling, using the freeze-substitution, post-embedding method, is associated with the pre-or post-synaptic mem-brane because of sterical distortion between the image of the membrane specialization formed from the whole thick-ness of the section and the most superficial layer available for the antibody. On the basis of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical studies, the weight of evidence is that most, if not all, of the immunolabelling that we observed is associated with the post-synaptic element Wisden et al., 1992 Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 Hartig et al., 1995 Caruncho et al., 1996, 1997 Liste et al., 1997 Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 Kultas-Ilinsky et al., 1998 . Identity of boutons forming receptor-positive synapses At least two classes of axon terminals were identified that formed GABAA receptor-positive synapses in the striatum, those that were associated with a high density of GABA immunogold particles and those with low or unde-tectable levels. There are at least four possible origins of the terminals with high levels of GABA 1. The medium spiny projection neuron, which accounts for the majority of striatal neurons and gives rise to local axon collaterals that form symmetrical synapses Wilson and Groves, 1980 Somogyi et al., 1981 Yung et al., 1996 , are GABAergic neurons see Smith and Bolam, 1990 . Their axon terminals in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra have been shown to be enriched in GABA see Smith et al., 1998 . 2. The population of GABA interneurons identified on the basis of the uptake of [3H]GABA Bolam et al., 1983 and by GAD immunolabeling Bolam et al., 1985 Kita and Kitai, 1988 . These neurons stain more strongly for GAD than do the medium spiny neurons Bolam et al., 1985 Kita and Kitai, 1988 and express immunoreactiv-ity for parvalbumin Cowan et al., 1990 Kita et al., 1990 their axon terminals within the striatum have been shown to form symmetrical synapses Cowan et al., 1990 Kita et al., 1990 Bennett and Bolam, 1994a, 1994b and are GABA-positive Kubota et al., 1993 Bennett and Bolam, 1994b . 3. The terminals formed by striatal interneurons that express nitric oxide synthase and those expressing the calcium binding protein calretinin, form symmetrical synapses Bennett and Bolam, 1993 Morello et al., 1997 and have been reported to be GABA positive Kubota et al., 1993 Clarke and Bolam, 1997 . 4. Asub-population of neurons in the globus pallidus gives rise to a projection to the striatum Staines et al., 1981 Beckstead, 1983 Jayaraman, 1983 Staines and Fibiger, 1984 Shu and Peterson, 1988 Walker et al., 1989 Kita and Kitai, 1994 Rajakumar et al., 1994 Spooren et al., 1996 Nambu and Llinas, 1997 Bevan et al., 1998 . These neurons are GABAergic Smith et al., 1998 they give rise to symmetrical synapses in the striatum and selectively innervate striatal interneurons Bevan et al., 1998 . The postsynaptic neurons included both medium spiny and GABA interneurons identified on the basis of both morphological and neurochemical criteria. From the known synaptology of the striatum Bolam and Bennett, 1995 , we can conclude that the GABAA receptor-positive synapses on spiny neurons are formed by the collaterals of spiny neurons themselves Wilson and Groves, 1980 Somogyi et al., 1981 Yung et al., 1996 but see below and or the terminals of GABA interneurons Kita et al., 1990 Kita, 1993 Bennett and Bolam, 1994a,b but not those of pallidostriatal neurons Bevan et al., 1998 . Those GABA-positive terminals forming receptor-positive synapses with GABA-positive neurons are likely to be derived from the globus pallidus Bevan et al., 1998 and possibly other GABA interneurons Bolam et al., 1985 . There are several possible explanations for the presence of the second population of axon terminals that formed GABAA receptor-positive synapses, i.e., those possessing low or undetectable levels of GABA. First, it is possible that the low or undetectable levels of GABAare a technical artifact caused by the failure to maintain the antigenicity for GABA within those boutons. This, however, is unlikely, as other boutons that were strongly positive for GABA and formed receptor-positive synapses were found in the vicinity of the boutons with the low levels of GABA. Furthermore, similar analyses in other regions of the basal ganglia entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta revealed the presence of much smaller proportions of boutons with low or undetect-able levels of GABA-forming receptor-positive synapses unpublished observations . This suggests that the higher proportion of GABA-poor boutons that formed receptor-positive synapses in the striatum is a characteristic of the striatum and not the technicalities of the procedures. A second possibility is that the terminals with low or unde-tectable levels of GABA truly represent a population of terminals that are GABAergic but are at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of their content of GABA and are simply below the level of detection in this tissue. There is evidence, albeit indirect, that different populations of GABAergic terminals in the striatum are derived from neurons that express different levels of GABA. Thus the parvalbumin-expressing GABA interneurons stain more strongly for GAD than striatal spiny neurons Bolam et al., 1985 Kita and Kitai, 1988 Kawaguchi et al., 1995 . Similarly, the terminals of globus pallidus neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus or the substantia nigra have higher levels of GABA immunoreactivity than do the terminals of spiny projection neurons in these regions Smith et al., 1998 . It is possible, therefore, that in the striatum the terminals of GABA interneurons and the terminals of globus pallidus neurons are those terminals with high levels of GABA and that the terminals with low or undetectable levels of GABA are the local axon termi-nals of the spiny projection neurons. A third possible explanation is that the terminals are indeed non-GABAergic but form synapses that are positive for GABA receptor subunits. Mismatches between the putative transmitter of synaptic terminals and the recep-tor located within the synapse have been reported for GABAand for other receptors. In the subthalamic nucleus, a population of terminals that have low levels of glutamate immunoreactivity and high level of GABA forms synapses that are positive for the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and the GluR2 3 subunits of the AMPA receptor Clarke and Bolam, 1998 . Furthermore, the g2, b2 3, and a6 subunits of the GABAA receptor have been shown to be concentrated in some glutamatergic mossy fibre synapses in the cerebellum Nusser et al., 1996b, 1998 . In the striatum, non-GABAergic terminals that form symmetri-cal synapses include dopaminergic axon terminals derived from the substantia nigra pars compacta Bouyer et al., 1984 Freund et al., 1984 Smith et al., 1994 Hanley and Bolam, 1997 and cholinergic terminals derived from cho-linergic interneurons Wainer et al., 1984 Izzo and Bolam, 1988 Pickel and Chan, 1990 . The possibility of the presence of GABAA receptors at synapses formed by these classes of terminals cannot, as yet, be excluded. Co-localization of GABAA receptor subunits at synapses The triple-labelling study revealed the presence of sym-metrical synapses that were positive for various combina-tions of the a, b, and g subunits. Thus synapses were observed that were labelled by one of the three antibodies, two out of the three antibodies and synapses that were positive for all three. Although negative findings are difficult to interpret, the present study indicates that a1, b2 3, and g2 receptor subunits of the GABAA receptor co-localize at individual synapses. This finding corrobo-rates previous radioligand-binding, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical studies indicating the co-localization of GABAA receptor subunits in the striatum at the regional and cellular levels Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 Caruncho et al., 1996, 1997 McKernan and Whiting, 1996 Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 Riedel et al., 1998 . In fact the a1, b2 3, and g2 receptor subunit configuration has been proposed as the most common for GABAA recep-tors in the mammalian brain. From pre-embedding immu-nocytochemical and in situ hybridisation studies Fritschy and Mohler, 1995 Caruncho et al., 1996, 1997 McKernan and Whiting, 1996 Liste et al., 1997 Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 Riedel et al., 1998 , it is evident that the a1 subunit in not expressed, or expressed at low levels, by medium spiny neurons but is expressed by small popula-tions of striatal neurons, which include GABA interneu-rons and a large type of projection neuron Caruncho et al., 1996 Waldvogel et al., 1997, 1998 . It is thus likely that the synapses that were positive for the a1 subunits with or without the b2 3 and g2 subunits are formed by these latter populations of neurons. Those synapses that were negative for the a1 subunits may express some other a subunit, possibly a2, and may thus represent the synapses of spiny neurons. It is thus evident that there are differ-ences in the GABAA receptor subunit profiles at synapses on medium-sized projection spiny neurons and those on interneurons in the striatum. RESULTS Distribution of immunogold labelling for GABAA receptor subunits Consistent with previous in situ hybridization and pre-embedding immunocytochemical studies see opening para-graphs , post-embedding immunolabelling of sections of the striatum revealed the presence of sites that were immunoreactive for the a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits of the GABAA receptor. They were identified by the presence of accumulations of immunogold particles. The antibody preparations directed against the b2 3 subunits gave the most robust labelling the analyses of the distribution of immunoparticles and the relationship of receptor-positive terminals to GABA-positive synapses were therefore car-ried out with antibodies against these subunits. Immunogold particles coding for the b2 3 subunits were widely distributed in the sections of the striatum Figs. 2â4 . They were closely associated with membranes Figs. 2â4 and were also localized at intracellular sites. The intracellular gold particles were associated with a variety of organelles including saccules of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the nuclear envelope. Although the intracellular labelling accounted for 54.4% of the gold particles, they most commonly occurred as single gold particles Figs. 2D,F, 3A, 4C and only rarely were associa-tions of two or more particles observed Fig. 3A,E . This contrasts with the labelling observed at symmetrical syn-apses see below and probably includes both specific labelling associated with the synthetic and transport machinery of the receptor as well as non-specific labelling. Forty-four percent of gold particles were associated with membranes, i.e., either touching the membrane or within 1 diameter of it. Of the membrane-associated particles, 55.5% were localized at symmetrical synapses where gold particles lined up along the synaptic specialization Figs. 2â4 . Immunopositive asymmetrical synapses were not observed. A large number of the gold particles at synapses were located on the external surface of the plasma mem-brane see insets in Figs. 2, 3D,E, 4AâD . The antibody used recognized the N-terminal sequence of the b2 and b3 subunits thus extracellular labeling is consistent with the predicted topography of the receptor subunits. However, it is not possible to localize an antigen unequivocally to the internal or external surface of the membrane, nor to the pre-or post-synaptic structure using post-embedding tech-niques because of the distortion between the image of the membrane specialization formed from the whole thickness of the section and the most superficial layer of the section available for the antibody. This is exemplified by the tangentially cut synapses where there is an accumulation of immunogold particles but no apparent synaptic mem-branes Fig. 2D . The labelling associated with membranes at extrasynaptic sites consisted mainly of isolated gold particles Fig. 3A , although clusters of two or more particles were sometimes seen Fig. 2C . Synaptology of synapses positive for the b2 3 subunits The post-synaptic structures at synapses positive for the b2 3 subunits of the GABAA receptor included dendrites Figs. 2BâE, 3A,B,D,E, 4A,C,D,E, 5 , spines Fig. 2D,F , and perikarya Figs. 2A, 3C, 4B . In keeping with the known data concerning symmetrical synapses in the stria-tum Ingham et al., 1998 , the majority of receptor-positive synapses were axodendritic Figs. 2BâE, 3A,B,D,E, 4A,C,D,E, 5 . Synapses with both small presumably dis-tal and large diameter dendrites, as well as proximal dendrites emerging from perikarya, were positive for the GABAA receptor subunits. At least two types of dendrites were identified first, dendrites with the characteristics of medium size densely spiny neurons Fig. 3E , i.e., they gave rise to dendritic spines and possessed morphological features of the dendrites of spiny neurons Somogyi and Smith, 1979 Wilson and Groves, 1980 and second, in the double-labeled material, dendrites were identified that displayed immunolabelling for GABA Fig. 3A,B,D see below , which is indicative of the GABA interneurons of the striatum Bolam et al., 1983 Kawaguchi et al., 1995 Kawaguchi, 1997 . Dendritic spines were the second most frequently ob-served post-synaptic structure at synapses positive for the b2 3 subunits Fig. 2D,F . The synapses generally occurred on the neck of the spine when visible , and the spine was often post-synaptic to another terminal that formed an asymmetric synapse Fig. 2D,E . Synapses positive for the b2 3 subunits of the GABAA receptor were observed on neuronal perikarya that had the ultrastructural characteristics of medium size densely spiny neurons, i.e., large non-indented nucleus and a relatively small volume of cytoplasm that was poor in organelles Somogyi and Smith, 1979 Dimova et al., 1980 Wilson and Groves, 1980 Figs. 2A, 4B . Multiple receptor-positive synapses were often detected on spiny neuron perikarya Fig. 2A . Receptor-positive synapses were also formed on the perikarya of neurons characterised as GABA interneurons on the basis of both morphology and neurochemistry Fig. 3C see below . GABA labelling of presynaptic boutons at synapses positive for the b2 3 subunits To gain insight into the nature of the terminals that form synapses positive for the b2 3 subunits, sections of the striatum were double immunostained to reveal both GABA and the b2 3 subunits. The immunolabelling for GABA 20-nm gold particles was similar to that described previously for the striatum and other regions of the basal ganglia Clarke and Bolam, 1997 Smith et al., 1998 . The GABA immunolabelling was widely distributed in the striatum with marked accumulations of immunogold par-ticles over a subset of axons, axon terminals, dendrites, and perikarya Figs. 2â4 . Systematic scans of double- labelled sections revealed that most 59.3% of the boutons forming synapses that were positive for the b2 3 subunits were also positive for GABA Figs. 2, 3, 4A,CâE . The boutons were of variable size and made symmetrical synaptic contacts with dendrites, spines, and perikarya. They contained from 0 to 4 mitochondria and sometimes formed synapses with more than one structure in the same plane Figs. 2C,E . In addition to the GABA-positive boutons, 40.7% of receptor-positive synapses were formed by boutons that possessed low or undetectable levels of GABA Fig. 4 . These synaptic boutons were identified in sections in which structures that were strongly labelled for GABA were identified in the close vicinity. Postsynaptic targets included spines not shown , dendrites Fig. 4A,Câ E , and perikarya Fig. 4B . A similar analysis of the boutons in the entopeduncular nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and pars compacta revealed that only 9.3%, 4.1%, and 3.8% of boutons forming receptor-positive synapses, respectively, possessed low or undetect-able levels of GABA unpublished observations . The double-labelled sections also enabled the chemical characterization of the post-synaptic structures involved in receptor-positive synapses. Thus, some of the dendrites and perikarya were themselves immunopositive for GABA Fig. 3 . The GABA-positive perikarya Fig. 3C possessed indentations in the nuclear membrane and a relatively large volume of cytoplasm compared with spiny neuron perikarya that was rich in organelles. These morphologi-cal features and the presence of GABA immunolabeling are characteristics of the GABA interneuron of the stria-tum that has been characterized on the basis of the uptake of exogenous GABA, GAD immunocytochemistry, and parv-albumin labelling Bolam et al., 1983, 1985 Kita and Kitai, 1988 Cowan et al., 1990 Kita et al., 1990 . Localization of a1 and g2 subunits Sections immunolabelled to reveal a1 and g2 subunits of the GABAA receptor revealed labelling for both subunits, although the labelling was not as robust as that obtained with the antibodies against the b2 3 subunits. Immuno-gold particles were observed both on membranes and at intracellular sites, but the most prominent labelling, in the form of groups of immunogold particles, occurred at sym-metrical synapses Fig. 5 . Labelling for each of the subunits was observed at symmetrical synapses involving spines, perikarya, and, most frequently, dendritic shafts Fig. 5 . Triple-labelling experiments for the a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits with three different sizes of gold particles re-vealed the co-localization of the GABAA receptor subunits at individual symmetrical synapses Fig. 5 . In a system-atic analysis of receptor-positive synapses, 42%, 92%, and 26% were positive for a1, b2 3, and g2 subunits, respec-tively. Colocalization for all three subunits occurred at 12% of the synapses, colocalization of a1 and b2 3 subunits at 22%, and colocalization of b2 3 and g2 subunits at 14%. Synapses were detected that exhibited labelling for only a1 8% or only b2 3 44% subunits. In this analysis, synapses with only single gold particles coding for a particular subunit were considered positive. Distribution of immunolabelling for b2 3 subunits across synapses The quantitative analysis in the striatum revealed that the immunoparticles labelling b2 3 subunits were, on average, evenly distributed across the width of the synap-tic specialization, although there was a tendency for reduced levels toward the edge Fig. 6 . Very few particles fell apparently outside the synaptic specialization at peri-synaptic sites. The exact location of immunoparticles at the edge of the synapse, however, is difficult to judge because of steric distortion between the image of the membrane specialization formed from the whole thickness of the section and the most superficial layer of the section available for the antibody and the difficulty of identifying the edge of symmetrical synapses in freeze-substituted tissue where the preservation is not optimal. CONCLUSIONS The present findings demonstrate the precise localiza-tion of subunits of the GABAA receptor in relation to symmetrical synaptic specializations in the rat striatum. The main conclusions that we can draw from this study are that GABAA receptor are primarily located at symmetrical synapses formed by boutons that are heterogeneous with respect to their morphology and neurochemistry and that different subunits colocalize at the level of individual synapses. The findings represent the first step in the elucidation of the chemical anatomy of the GABA-mediated synaptic circuits of the striatum in which the anatomical connections, transmitter neurochemistry, and transmitter receptors are localized. Experiments are in progress to identify the origin of the synaptic boutons involved in these circuits.

J. Comp. Neurol. 416 383â397, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. In response to various forms of stress, including hyper-thermia and ischemia, cells from many organisms increase the expression of a class of proteins referred to as heat shock proteins Currie and White, 1981 Brown, 1983 Nowak, 1985 . Heat shock proteins are classified according to their molecular weight into three general families Hsp90 84â90 kDa , Hsp70 68â78 kDa , and the small heat shock proteins 20â30 kDa see Morimoto et al., 1990 Craig et al., 1994 for review . In injured cells, heat shock proteins contribute to cellular repair processes by refold-ing denatured proteins Pelham, 1986 Becker and Craig, 1994 . It is now clear that many heat shock proteins are also constitutively expressed and are believed to act as molecular chaperones during regular protein transloca-tion or folding Ellis, 1987 Ellis and van der Vies, 1991 Georgopolous and Welch, 1993 Craig et al., 1994 Hen-drick and Hartl, 1993 . The murine Hsp25 is the homologous protein to the rat 27-kDa heat shock protein Hsp27 Plumier et al., 1996, 1997c . The rat Hsp27 is constitutively expressed in many motor and sensory neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord Plumier et al., 1997c . In addition, the rat Hsp27 is highly and selectively inducible in astrocytes Plumier et al., 1996, 1997a,b and neurons Hopkins et al., 1998 . However, very little is known about the function of this low molecular weight heat shock protein in the central nervous system. In contrast, in non-neuronal cells a number of functions have been suggested for Hsp25 27 such as acting as a molecular chaperone Jakob et al., 1993 , regulation of actin dynamics Lavoie et al., 1993a,b , regulating antioxi-dative activity Mehlen et al., 1995, 1996a,b , and blocking apoptosis Mehlen et al., 1996b Samali and Cotter, 1996 . Recently, Hsp27 has been shown to protect cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from apoptosis induced by with-drawal of nerve growth factor and to protect an established neuronal cell line from retinoic acid-induced apoptosis Wagstaff et al., 1999 . The role of constitutive Hsp27 in neurons or selectively induced Hsp27 in either neurons or astrocytes in vivo is unknown. There has been no description of the constitutive expres-sion of Hsp25 27 in the rodent cerebellum. Indeed, Hsp25 27 was not detected in the naive adult rat cerebel-lum by using immunocytochemistry Wilkinson and Pol-lard, 1993 Plumier et al., 1997c or in the naive adult mouse brain by using Western blot analysis Tanguay et al., 1993 Klemenz et al., 1993 . We now report that the low molecular weight heat shock protein Hsp25 is constitu-tively expressed in parasagittal bands of Purkinje cells in distinct lobules in the adult mouse cerebellum. All Purkinje cells in the cerebellum have a very similar morphology and connectivity, yet they have diverse pat-terns of gene expression for reviews see Hawkes and Gravel, 1991 Hawkes and Eisenman, 1997 Herrup and Kuemerle, 1997 Oberdick et al., 1998 . One of the most extensively studied Purkinje cell differentiation antigens is zebrin II Brochu et al., 1990 Eisenman and Hawkes, 1993 , which cloning studies have revealed is the respira-tory isoenzyme aldolase C Ahn et al., 1994 Hawkes and Herrup, 1996 . Zebrin IIâimmunoreactive Purkinje cells are clustered in parasagittal bands that extend through the majority of the cerebellum, dividing the cerebellar cortex into distinct compartments. In addition to the parasagittal compartmentation, the vermis of the cerebel-lar cortex can also be divided transversely into four anterior-posterior zones the anterior zone AZ lobules IâV , the central zone CZ lobules VIâVII , the posterior zone PZ lobule VIII and the nodular zone NZ lob-ules IXâX reviewed in Hawkes and Eisenman, 1997 Ozol et al., 1999 . Zebrin II bands are prominent features of theAZ and the PZ, but in the CZ and the NZ all Purkinje cells express zebrin II Brochu et al., 1990 Hawkes and Eisenman, 1993 . Similarly, in the hemispheres, zebrin II immunocy-tochemistry reveals bands in most lobules but is uniformly expressed by all Purkinje cells in the paraflocculus and flocculus. However, although zebrin II expression fails to differentiate between subsets of Purkinje cells in these lobules, previous reports have demonstrated that Purkinje cells in the CZ, NZ, and paraflocculus flocculus are compart-mentalized with respect to their afferent and efferent connectivity rabbit, Yamamoto and Shimoyama, 1977 Balaban and Henry, 1988 Wylie et al., 1994 De Zeeuw et al., 1994 Tan et al., 1995a,b rat, Serapide et al., 1994 Tolbert and Gutting, 1997 and electrophysiological charac-teristics Ito, 1982 Kano et al., 1990 . The present data indicate that Hsp25 is the first molecular marker to reveal Purkinje cell heterogeneity in the CZ, the NZ, and the paraflocculus flocculus in the adult cerebellar cortex. The data reveal a unique distribution with two distinctive features. First, Hsp25-immunoreactive Purkinje cells are confined to those regions of the cerebellar cortex in which zebrins are expressed uniformly â CZ, NZ, and the flocculus paraflocculus. Second, Hsp25 expression reveals parasagittal bands of Purkinje cells, alternating with unreactive bands within these regions. For these reasons, Hsp25 will prove a valuable marker to explore the develop-ment and connectivity of the mouse cerebellum. MATERIALS AND METHODS All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Adult CD1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, St. Constant, Province of Quebec. Adult C3HHeHa and C3HHeSnJ mice were a gift from Dr. F. Biddle University of Calgary . Western blot analysis Tissue was homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose and protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. 1951 . Samples containing 20 Î¼g of protein were solubi-lized in sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS sample buffer 10% glycerol, 5% b -mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS in upper Tris buffer [0.125 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8 0.1% SDS] , boiled for 10 minutes and then loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel 2.5% upper gel, 12% running gel according to the method of Laemmli 1970 . Mid-range protein molecular weight mark-ers 2 Î¼l per lane Promega, Inc., Madison, WI were treated in the same way and loaded in parallel. Samples were electrophoresed at 75 V for 20 minutes and then at 125 V for 45 minutes. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane Millipore, Mississauga, ON at 30 V for 18 hours. Membranes were air-dried. For immunostaining, membranes were first saturated with methanol, rinsed with 13 phosphate buff-ered saline PBS pH 7.4 and then washed for 10 minutes in 13 PBS 0.2% Tween 80 at 37Â°C. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at 37Â°C in 5% skim milk 1% bovine serum albumin in 13 PBS. Primary rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the murine 25-kDa heat shock protein Hsp25 SPA-801, StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada was diluted 1 1,000 in 5% skim milk 1% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody at 4Â°C for 18 hours with gentle agitation. Mem-branes were washed 3 3 20 minutes in PBS 0.2% Tween 80 at 37Â°C and then incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C with peroxidase labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG Vector Laborato-ries, Inc., Burlingame, CA diluted 1 2,000 in PBS 0.2% Tween 80. Blots were washed 1 3 15 minutes and 4 3 5 minutes in 13 PBS 0.2% Tween 80 at 37Â°C and peroxidase binding was detected by using the electrogenerated chemi-luminescence Western blot detection kit and Hyperfilm ECL Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL . Perfusions and sectioning All mice were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pento-barbital 100 mg kg, i.p. and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 followed by 100 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.01% glutaralde-hyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . The brains were then removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative at 4Â°C for 24 hours, and stored in Millonigâs solution. Series of 50-Î¼m-thick transverse sections were cut through the rostrocaudal extent of the cerebellum on a Vibratome. Hsp25 immunohistochemistry Cerebellar sections for immunohistochemistry were washed for 30 minutes in 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.6 containing 1% hydrogen peroxide followed by 15 minutes each in 0.1 M Tris buffer, 0.1 M Tris buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X Tris A , and 0.1 M Tris buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X and 0.005% bovine serum albumin Tris B . The tissue was then incubated in Tris B containing the primary antibody anti-Hsp25 1 10,000, SPA-801, StressGen, Victo- ria, BC for 16â18 hours at 4Â°C. Sections were then washed for 15 minutes each in Tris A pH 7.6 and Tris B pH 7.6 and incubated in Tris B containing biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit antibody 1 400, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA for 45 minutes at 4Â°C. After incubation in secondary antibody, the sections were washed for 15 minutes each in Tris A and 0.05 M Tris buffer containing 0.01% Triton X Tris D pH 7.6 and then reacted with the Vectastain ABC staining kit 1 1,000, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA and Tris D for 1 hour. This step was followed by 3 3 5 minute washes in 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.6 and a 15-minute reaction period in diaminobenzidine DAB . To confirm the specificity of the anti-Hsp25 antiserum, some sections were incubated in anti-Hsp25 1 10,000 combined with various blocking concentrations of the Hsp25 protein StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia . After washing in 0.1 M Tris buffer, the sections were mounted onto chrome-alum and gelatin subbed slides, air-dried overnight, dehydrated through an alcohol series, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped with DPX mounting medium BDH Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario . Double labeling of cerebellar sections Cerebellar sections for fluorescent immunohistochemis-try were washed for 15 minutes each in 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.6 , Tris A pH 7.6 , and Tris B pH 7.6 . The tissue was then incubated in Tris B containing 10% normal donkey serum Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA for 60 minutes and incubated in Tris B containing a combination of the primary antibodies anti-Hsp25 1 10,000 , or anti-zebrin II spent culture medium diluted 1 100, Brochu et al., 1990 for 16â18 hours at 4Â°C. After incubation in primary antibodies, sections were washed for 15 minutes in 0.1 M Tris buffer and then left in Tris B containing CY2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit sec-ondary antibody 1 800, Jackson Immunoresearch Labora-tories and CY3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody 1 800, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories for 24â48 hours at 4Â°C. After incubation in secondary antibody, the sections were washed for 15 minutes in 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.6 , mounted onto chrome-alumâ and gelatin-subbed slides, air-dried overnight, cleared in 0.1M Tris buffer pH 7.6 , and cover-slipped with nonfluorescing mounting medium Fluorsave Reagent, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA . Photomicrographs and Reconstructions Images of sections were digitally captured by using a Photometrics Quantix camera Optikon Corp., Ltd. and arranged in Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Adobe Illustrator 8.0 was used to create the lobular reconstructions. DISCUSSION Western analysis and immunohistochemistry present a consistent picture of Hsp25 immunoreactivity in the adult mouse cerebellum. Hsp25 is constitutively expressed in a small subset of Purkinje cells in lobules VI VII and IX X of the vermis Fig. 11 and the paraflocculus and flocculus of the adult mouse cerebellum. Despite that no constitutive Hsp27 expression is seen in rat cerebellum Fig. 3 Plumier et al., 1997c , several lines of evidence convince us that the expression pattern that we see reflects the intrinsic distri-bution of the murine Hsp25. First, Western blot analysis detected a single band at an apparent molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa Fig. 1 . Second, Western blot analysis comparing the anterior and posterior halves of the adult mouse cerebellum Fig. 4 was consistent with the Hsp25 immunohistochemistry in that the antigen levels were higher in the posterior vermis where more Purkinje cells were Hsp25 positive and lower in the anterior lobe where Hsp25 immunopositive Purkinje cells were absent Fig. 2 . Third, Hsp25-immunohistochemical staining was blocked by the addition of the recombinant murine Hsp25 25-kDa protein to the primary antibody Fig. 5 . Fourth, the immunohistochemical distribution of constitutively expressed Hsp25 in other regions of the adult mouse brain Armstrong et al., personal communica-tion closely resembles that in the rat Plumier et al., 1997c . Hsp25 expression in the CZ Previous reports have demonstrated that lobules VI and VII of the vermis can be divided into discrete parasagittal zones â each with its own efferent target and individual climbing fiber afferents for review see Voogd et al., 1985 Voogd and Ruigrok, 1997 . The CZ Purkinje cells primarily receive olivocerebellar afferents, originating in various subnuclei of the inferior olive, that terminate in longitudi-nal bands. In turn, the Purkinje cells within these bands project to specific regions of the fastigial and interposed nuclei see Buisseret-Delmas andAngaut, 1993 Voogd and Glickstein, 1998, for review . Furthermore, anterograde tracing studies in the rat have shown that pontocerebellar and cuneocerebellar mossy fibers terminate in lobules VI VII in parasagittal stripes Serapide et al., 1994 Tol- bert and Gutting, 1997 . Consistent with this evidence of compartmentalization in lobule VI, Hsp25 is the first molecular marker to demonstrate parasagittal bands in Purkinje cells â a midline band and two others bilaterally. Hsp25 expression in the NZ Previous reports of compartmentation have demon-strated that the NZ, consisting of lobules IX X, can also be divided into zones according to the organization of their afferent and efferent connectivity Voogd, 1969 Groenewe-gen and Voogd, 1977 Brodal and Brodal, 1981 Balaban and Henry, 1988 Kano et al., 1990 Tan et al., 1995b . In rabbits, olivocerebellar fibers originating in specific oli-vary nuclei terminate in five distinct zones in lobule X Katayama and Nisimaru, 1988 Tan et al., 1995b , al-though there is evidence that this organization may vary between different species Voogd and Ruigrok, 1997 . Lobule X, along with the flocculus, is part of the vestibulo-cerebellum and receives mossy fiber input from vestibular nuclei. Within these bands, the Purkinje cells project to specific regions of the superior and medial vestibular nuclei or to the fastigial nuclei Wylie et al., 1994 Tan et al., 1995a . Furthermore, subsets of Purkinje cells in lobule X can be differentiated by using PEP19 in perinatal rats Wassef et al., 1992 and an olfactory marker protein in perinatal mice Nunzi et al., 1999 . However, in adult lobule X as in lobule VI , there is no molecular marker that can differentiate between Purkinje cells, despite the evidence for compartmentalization. Hsp25 is the first molecular marker to demonstrate a parasagittal banding pattern in lobule X in the adult cerebellar cortex. The NZ contains three parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunoreac-tive Purkinje cells at the posterior tip of lobule IX and five parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunoreactive Purkinje cells at the widest aspect of the ventral surface of lobule IX. In lobule X, these five bands condense to form three larger bands that appear to merge at the anterior tip of lobule X. The anterior boundary between the PZ and the NZ was previously believed to be an abrupt discontinuity at the base of the posterolateral fissure Hawkes and Eisenman, 1997 Ozol et al., 1999 . This made the interface between the PZ and NZ different from other transverse zone boundaries where Purkinje cells from each side of the boundary interdigitate over a distance of several hundred micrometers. However, the identification of narrow Hsp25-immunopositive bands in the ventral face of lobule IX suggests the presence of a transition region here as well. As in lobule VII, the Hsp25-immunopositive bands in lobule IX partially overlap with the zebrin-positive P11-P41 bands, subdividing them into smaller units. Hsp25 expression in the paraflocculus and flocculus. Traditional interpretations of gross cerebellar anatomy treat the paraflocculus and flocculus as the lateral exten-sions of lobules IX and X, respectively. Therefore, it is interesting that Hsp25 expression is specific to Purkinje cells in both of these regions. Previous reports have concluded that the flocculus can also be divided into zones on the basis of afferent and efferent connectivity Yama-moto and Shimoyama, 1977 Yamamoto, 1979 Ruigrok et al., 1992 Tan et al., 1995a,b , acetylcholinesterase cyto- chemistry Tan et al., 1995c and physiological responses Kano et al., 1990 van der Steen et al., 1994 . For example, olivocerebellar fibers originating in specific olivary subnu-clei terminate in four distinct zones in the flocculus of the rabbit Tan et al., 1995b . The boundaries of these zones correspond to those determined by rotational optokinetic stimulation van der Steen et al., 1994 and by microstimu-lation and recording from specific vestibular-ocular reflex pathways Ito, 1982 . In addition to physiological zones, Yamamoto and Shimoyama 1977 found that Purkinje cells of the rabbit flocculus that project to different areas in the vestibular nuclei are distributed in a striped pattern see also Tan et al., 1995a . The parafloccular floccular reconstruction of Hsp25 expression Fig. 8 revealed a banded organization that appears to run perpendicular to the zonation observed in olivocerebellar connectivity in the rat Ruigrok et al., 1992 . Thus, it is not clear how the Hsp25-immunopositive bands relate to previously identi-fied compartments. Constitutive Hsp25 expression reveals complexity in cerebellar organization Previously described compartmentation markers of the adult cerebellum do not distinguish between different populations of Purkinje cells in lobules VI or X, despite reports that the CZ and the NZ of the cerebellar cortex are compartmentalized with respect to afferent and efferent connectivity and physiological characteristics. The data presented above summarized in Fig. 11 , for the first time allow us to distinguish between subsets of Purkinje cells in lobule VI CZ and X NZ . Constitutive expression of Hsp25 in the adult mouse cerebellum has two important implications for our under-standing of the organization of the cerebellar cortex. Differential patterns of gene expression in the neonate and the adult mouse cerebellum suggest that there are at least four distinct transverse zones the AZ, CZ, PZ, and NZ reviewed in Hawkes and Eisenman, 1997 Ozol et al., 1999 . Hsp25 immunoreactivity is restricted to the CZ and the NZ. Previous molecular criteria for the CZ and NZ were that both zones express zebrin II aldolase C in all Purkinje cells, without evidence of parasagittal bands. Hsp25 is not only preferentially expressed in the CZ and the VZ, but it is expressed in parasagittal bands. Second, the parasagittal banding pattern of Hsp25 immunoreactivity reveals novel subsets of Purkinje cells within apparently homogenous zebrin-positive bands e.g., lobule IX Fig. 9 . This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that afferent inputs can distinguish sub-compartments within apparently homogeneous zebrin bands e.g., Wassef et al., 1992 Ji and Hawkes, 1994, 1995 Akintunde and Eisenman, 1994 Voogd and Ruigrok, 1997 . Hsp25 function in the cerebellar cortex The role of Hsp25 in the cerebellum is unknown. One possibility is that Hsp25 is ââconstitutively inducedââ by the afferent innervation to the Purkinje cells. Lobule VI receives inputs from the visual cortex by means of the basilar pontine afferents, whereas lobules IX, X, and the paraflocculus flocculus receive vestibulo-ocular input. Be-cause all three expression domains share a common visuo-motor component, it may be that the ââconstitutiveââ expres-sion of Hsp25 is sustained by visual input. This possibility was tested in the C3HHeHa Fig. 10 and C3HHeSnJ mice data not shown , which are blind after 6 weeks postnatal, owing to retinal degeneration Lucas, 1958 Sidman and Green, 1965 Sanyal and Bal, 1973 . No difference in the pattern of Hsp25 was found compared with normal con-trols. Furthermore, it should be noted that studies of Hsp25 induction after heat shock in the rat have not revealed Purkinje cell expression, nor is it clear why visuomotor function should differ significantly between rats and mice. Although it is tempting to speculate on possible func-tions based on the restricted expression patterns seen in the adult mouse cerebellum, it is important to recall that similar patterns of expression are not seen for Hsp27 in the rat cerebellum Fig. 3 Plumier et al., 1997c . Regard-less, the constitutive expression of Hsp25 in parasagittal bands in the adult mouse cerebellum serves to increase our understanding of cerebellar organization, particularly in lobule VI, X, and the flocculus where zebrin II expression is uniform. RESULTS Western blot analyses of adult mouse cerebellar homoge-nates, by using the polyclonal antibody raised against the murine Hsp25, revealed a single band of apparent molecu-lar weight 25 kDa Fig. 1A . Immunohistochemistry was used to localize Hsp25 immunoreactivity in the adult CD1 mouse cerebellum. All immunoreactivity, apart from weak staining of blood vessels and ependymal cells, was specifi-cally localized in Purkinje cells Fig. 1B,C . Reaction product was deposited throughout the dendritic arbor, somata, and axons. The nuclei of the Purkinje cells were not labeled. Other cerebellar neurons, and glial cells, were unreactive. Weakly stained Hsp25-immunopositive axons with occasional varicosities are seen in the lateral and medial vestibular nuclei and in some cerebellar nuclei e.g., lateral portion of the interposed nuclei Fig. 1C but not others e.g., the medial or anterior interposed nuclei . Only a small subset of Purkinje cells express Hsp25. Transverse sections taken through the caudal to rostral extent of the cerebellum demonstrate that Hsp25-immuno-reactive Purkinje cells are confined exclusively to two regions of the vermis â lobules VI VII and IX X Fig. 2AâF â plus the paraflocculus and flocculus Figs. 2G, 8 . Within all three regions, Hsp25-immunoreactive Purkinje cells are arrayed as bands. No Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells were seen in the hemispheres or the vermis of the anterior lobe. The distribution of Hsp25-immunore-active Purkinje cells was highly reproducible between individual mice. In accordance with previous reports Wilkinson and Pollard, 1993 Plumier et al., 1997c , Hsp27-immunoposi-tive cells were seen in various sensory and motor neurons in the rat central nervous system but not in the naive rat cerebellum Fig. 3 . However, a few Hsp27-immunoposi-tive axon fibers and terminals were seen in the lateral portion of the interposed nuclei possibly projecting from the dorsal vagal nuclei Chan-Palay, 1977 . To confirm that the distribution of reaction product in histologic material represented the true distribution of murine Hsp25, Western analysis was done on a series of samples dissected from either the anterior lobe vermis lobules IâV or the remainder of the vermis lobules VIâX Fig. 4 . The Western analysis was consistent with the immunohistochemistry â weak immunoreactivity was detected in the sample from the anterior lobe presumably reflecting the low levels of Hsp25 in the blood vessels and ependyma , whereas much stronger staining is seen from extracts taken from the posterior vermis. A densitometric scan of the Western blot confirmed a fourfold difference between the levels of protein in the anterior and the posterior cerebellum. Furthermore, Hsp25 immunoreactiv-ity was blocked â both in the Purkinje cells and in brainstem nuclei â by the addition of 0.25 Î¼g ml of Hsp25 protein to the primary antibody Fig. 5 . Hsp25 expression in the CZ The CZ of the cerebellar cortex, consisting of lobules VI and VII in the vermis, contains parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells Fig. 2BâD . Occa-sionally, a single Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cell was seen in the vermis of lobule VIII data not shown otherwise, no Hsp25 immunoreactivity was detected in the PZ. The distribution of immunoreactive Purkinje cells in lobules VI and VII was reconstructed from serial trans-verse sections Fig. 6 . Four bilateral parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells â located approxi-mately 300 Î¼m and 800 Î¼m from the midline â extend caudally 1.5 mm from the anterior tip of lobule VI through the superior posterior fissure to the posterior tip of lobule VII. A fifth midline parasagittal band also extends from the anterior tip of lobule VI but terminates caudally on the dorsal surface of lobule VII. Given that all Purkinje cells are believed to project to cerebellar nuclei on the ipsilat-eral side, it is probable that the midline band is actually two contiguous bands Fig. 1B . Hsp25 expression in the NZ The NZ, consisting of lobules IX and X in the vermis, also contains parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunopositive Pur-kinje cells Fig. 2AâE . Parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunoreactive Purkinje cells extend from the posterior tip of lobule IX, around the posterolateral fissure, to the anterior tip of lobule X, where all Purkinje cells express Hsp25 Fig. 2F . The distribution of immunoreactive Pur-kinje cells in lobules IX and X was reconstructed from serial transverse sections Fig. 7 . Three Hsp25-immu-nopositive bands are seen at the posterior tip of lobule IX, which become five thin 2â3 Purkinje cells in width parasagittal bands at the widest aspect of the ventral surface of lobule IX. The ventral and dorsal surfaces of lobule X contain three larger 10â15 Purkinje cells in width parasagittal bands of Hsp25-immunopositive cells. No Hsp25 immunoreactivity was seen beyond the tip of the lobule into the dorsal surface of lobule IX. Hsp25 expression in the flocculus and paraflocculus In addition to Hsp25 immunoreactivity in the vermis, Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells were also seen in the paraflocculus and the flocculus Fig. 8 . Hsp25-immunoreactive Purkinje cells were arranged in three main clusters Fig. 8A as a crescent surrounding the posterolateral fissure that separates the paraflocculus from the flocculus Fig. 8B,C,E,F , at the base of the parafloccular sulcus Fig. 8E,F , and in the ventral surface of the paraflocculus Fig. 8B,D. In addition, occasional immunoreactive Purkinje cells were seen at the ventrome-dial limit of the flocculus. Hsp25 and other compartmentation markers Transverse sections through the posterior cerebellum that were double labeled for Hsp25 and zebrin II demon-strate that all Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells also express zebrin II Fig. 9 . In the vermis of lobule VI and X, all Purkinje cells express zebrin II. However, in the transition zones between CZ and PZ lobule VII and PZ and NZ lobule IX , parasagittal bands of zebrin-positive Purkinje cells alternate with zebrin-negative bands Bro-chu et al., 1990 Eisenman and Hawkes, 1993 . There is a zebrin IIâpositive band at the midline P11 and three zebrin IIâpositive bands laterally P21, P31, and P41 . In all cases, Hsp25 expression subdivided the zebrin IIâ positive bands. In ventral lobule VII, Hsp25-immunoposi-tive Purkinje cells form two parasagittal bands Fig. 6 that lie within the lateral portion of the P21 zebrin band Fig. 9A . In ventral lobule IX, Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells form five parasagittal bands â one at the midline and two laterally on each side. These bands were located in the most lateral portion of P41 and in the middle of P31 Fig. 9A . At the midline, the distribution of Hsp25-immunoreactive Purkinje cells of ventral lobule IX is more complex Fig. 9B,C . Most caudally, Hsp25-immunopositive Purkinje cells lie in the middle of the P11 zebrin band on either side of the midline, abutted by Hsp25-unreactive, zebrin IIâpositive, cells Fig. 9B . Ros-trally, the midline Hsp25-immunopositive band splits in-totwo components, one at the lateral edge of P11, the other at the medial edge of P21 Fig. 9C . The intervening zebrin II-negative Purkinje cells of P12 do not express Hsp25. Because the single midline band seen more caudally in P11 is partitioned between P11 and P21 rostrally, it may actually compose four distinct bands, each 1â2 cells thick. Hsp25 expression in genetically blind mice The three primary Hsp25 expression domains â CZ, NZ, and the paraflocculus flocculus â all receive visuomo-tor input. Therefore, to test the theory that visual input constitutively induces Hsp25 expression, we examined the distribution of Hsp25 immunoreactivity in two strains of genetically blind mice Fig. 10 . Both C3HHeHa and C3HHeSn mice carry the mutant gene rd Lucas, 1958 Sidman and Green, 1965 and show selective degeneration of the photoreceptor cells after their initial differentiation Sanyal and Bal, 1973 . There was no difference in the Hsp25 expression between either of these mice and normal CD1 control animals.

Studies on honey bees and species of ants suggest that these centers are particularly prominent in social insects. The present study confirms the presence of large mushroom bodies in five subfamilies of vespid wasps, while at the same time showing significant departures from the mushroom body organization that typifies bees and ants. Although the basic organizational plan of the insect mushroom body into calyces, peduncle, and lobes is maintained, as is the arrangement of axons of intrinsic neurons, the size and arrangements of the vespid mushroom body lobes differ markedly from those known from other Hymenoptera. Furthermore, considerable variation is found both between and within vespid subfamilies.

J. Comp. Neurol. 416 143â157, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Complete repair of severed cut or crushed axonal processes depends on the successful completion of many events, including repair of damaged axolemmal membranes and axoplasmic structures, recovery of axonal function action potentials, axonal transport, etc. , and reconnec-tion with the original target cell by outgrowth from the proximal segment or by other means. Many studies of axonal regeneration have described restorative processes beginning with neuritic outgrowth, extension, and recon-nection to denervated structures Ramo Â´n y Cajal, 1928 for reviews, see Das and Wallace, 1986 Fu and Gordon, 1997 . Some recent studies have focused on the early phase of axonal repair beginning with the formation of a barrier to the entry of dye molecules and or ions at cut axonal ends Xie and Barrett, 1991 Krause et al., 1994 Ballinger et al., 1997 Eddleman et al., 1997 Godell et al., 1997 . This barrier forms amid an accumulation of vesicles and other membranous structures Krause et al., 1994 Ballinger et al., 1997 Eddleman et al., 1997, 1998 Godell et al., 1997 . We have also shown that the formation of this barrier depends on the time after internal calcium increases PC time , rather than the posttransection PT time Blan-chette et al., 1999 . That is, calcium inflow, rather than injury per se, initiates and controls the sealing process. However, no studies have examined whether this barrier is stable, once formed at any time PC or PT, or have described events in the interval from axonal repair to the onset of neuritic outgrowth. In this paper, we report observations on the cut ends of invertebrate myelinated earthworm giant axons GAs during an interval extending from the initial formation of a barrier to dye diffusion 15 minutes PT or PC through the formation of neuritic outgrowths 2â10 days PT . The following sequence of morphological changes occurred during this 15 minuteâ10 day-interval 1. At 15 minutes PC, a barrier to dye diffusion formed amid an accumulation of vesicles and myelin-derived multilayered membranous structures, as previously described Ballinger et al., 1997 . 2. From 15 to 35 minutes PC, this barrier was unstable with respect to its location and configuration. 3. From 35 minutes PC to 12 hours PT, this barrier remained rather stable amid an accumulation of vesicles, myelin-derived structures, or other abnormal membranous structures. 4. From 1 to 10 days PT, the abnormal membranous structures had largely or completely disappeared from the cut end, where a dye barrier was formed by a continuous plasma membrane neuritic outgrowths emerged from such repaired axonal ends at 2â10 days MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal surgery Adult earthworms Lumbricus terrestris 100â150 seg-ments in length were obtained from a local bait shop Coldspring Bait Company, Cleveland, TX , maintained in moistened peat bedding at 15Â°C, and fed regularly. Ventral nerve cords VNCs were dissected from 30â40 body seg-ments of animals anesthetized in 0.3% w w chloretone. VNCs were bathed in either physiological saline contain-ing 40 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Na2SO2, 15 mM Na-acetate, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 0.05 mM carbachol, 1.25 mM Tris, and 1.4 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 181 mOsm or a Ca21-free saline that contained all of the above except that CaCl2 was omitted and 1 mM EGTA was added. VNCs were transected at about the 75th body segment with microscissors midway between the rostral and caudal septal junctions of medial GAs MGAs viewed under a dissecting microscope. The VNC in each body segment Fig. 1A contains three invertebrate myelinated GAs, one MGA and two lateral GAs LGAs . The cut ends of severed MGAs protruded about 200 Î¼m from the cut ends of the rest of the VNC. For acute experiments, about 5 VNC segments on either side of the transected segment were placed in a well CoverWell, Grace Bio-Labs, Sunriver, OR on a microscope slide. For chronic experiments, operated earthworms were placed on moistened filter paper and stored in large Petri dishes for 24 hours after lesioning to allow the integument to heal before returning the animal to peat bedding. Lesioned animals were reanesthetized at postoperative intervals ranging from 5 hours to 10 days. VNCs were then removed from the animal and fixed for histological or ultrastructural analyses or dye-injected for whole mount viewing. Different tissues were used for histo-logical ultrastructural analyses vs. whole-mount viewing because some ultrastructural details were not well pre-served following dye injection and whole-mount viewing. For whole-mount viewing, the exposed ends of earth-worm GAs were imaged using confocal and differential interference contrast DIC microscopy with a Leica TCS-4D fitted with two water immersion lenses a 403, 0.75 numerical aperture and a 633, 0.90 numerical aperture from Zeiss and a 103, 0.30 numerical aperture lens from Leica. Digitized DIC and confocal images were stored and analyzed on a Macintosh 7200 90 equipped with NIH image 1.6 and Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software. No differ-ences were noted in these studies between the response of the proximal vs. distal cut ends of MGAs, which protruded from the rostral vs. the caudal ends, respectively, of severed VNCs Fig. 1A . No consistent differences were noted between proximal or distal stumps of LGAs or between LGAs and MGAs at any time PT. Confocal fluorescence microscopy The following membrane-impermeant, hydrophilic, fluo-rescent dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes Eugene, OR fluorescein-dextran 488 nm excitation wavelength and Texas Red-dextran 548 nm Cy5-dextran 648 nm was obtained from Amersham Arlington Heights, IL . These dyes were added at a concentration of 0.1% wt vol to the external bath at various times after transection. No differences were noted in the data obtained for the differ-ent hydrophilic dyes. We used the method of Ballinger et al. 1997 to deter-mine whether hydrophilic dyes were excluded, or were taken up, by the cut ends of earthworm GAs. That is, for each recorded GA image, we adjusted the intensity of the bath confocal fluorescence image to just below the maxi-mum value and calculated the average pixel value of the confocal fluorescence intensity of several 2â4 pixel areas in the midsagittal Z-plane of the axoplasm at the cut end of an GA relative to the average pixel fluorescence intensity of several similar pixel areas in the bath. The midsagittal Z-plane was defined as the Z-plane parallel to the long axis of a GA in which the GA exhibited its largest diameter. This measure was expressed as the ratio of the average pixel intensity of the axoplasm to that of the bath. Our definition of dye exclusion required that this ratio calcu-lated as a percentage be ,5%. In almost all cases of dye exclusion vs. dye uptake, the ratios were ,1% vs. .25%, respectively, as reported by Ballinger et al. 1997 . The fluorescence ratio was typically assessed 5 minutes after adding the dye to the bath longer dye incubation times gave the same results for more than 20 MGAs imaged with confocal microscopy for 5â45 minutes after adding the dye to the bath. The cut ends of MGAs and not of LGAs were confocally viewed at from 0 to 1 hour PT or PC because MGAs but not LGAs protrude from the cut ends of the VNC Krause et al., 1994 . We used a PC, rather than a PT, paradigm for viewing the dye barrier within minutes to hours after its formation because MGA cut ends could be confocally imaged more rapidly after calcium addition than after transection and because MGAs could be easily backloaded with hydrophilic dyes once severed in calcium-free saline. The external membranes in contact with the bath saline plasmalemma and myelin layers of MGAs were some-times pulse-labeled with styryl dyes [0.01% wt vol FM1â43 488 nm or FM4â64 568 nm from Molecular Probes] by incubating intact MGAs for 10â15 minutes in physiologi-cal saline containing a styryl dye. [Styryl dyes readily partition into membranous structures, fluoresce only when incorporated into membranous structures, and do not pass through membranous structures so that internal mem-branes e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, etc. of intact cells are not FM-labeled Betz et al., 1992 Eddle-man et al., 1997 ]. The styryl dye in the bath was then rinsed out by several washes with physiological saline. The external membranes pulse-labeled by such a brief expo- sure to a styryl dye fluoresced for more than an hour after removal of the dye from the extracellular bath. We refer to axons labeled by this procedure as FM-labeled MGAs. No differences were noted in the data from MGAs FM-labeled using FM1â43 vs. FM4â64. No differences were noted in the ability of FM-labeled vs. non-FM-labeled MGAs to exclude hydrophilic dyes placed in the bath or retain backloaded hydrophilic dyes or in the time course of myelin delamination, or in the shape or movement of FM-labeled membranous structures. In double or triple dye experiments, confocal images of the dyes each excited at different wavelengths, e.g., fluorescein-dextran 488 nm and Texas Red-dextran 548 nm , were acquired simultaneously in different channels. To ensure that the fluorescence intensity patterns in each channel were inde-pendent of each other showed no cross-talk , we compared the patterns in images of each channel when each dye was excited separately and sequentially with the patterns in images when all dyes were excited simultaneously. In all cases, the intensity patterns in simultaneous images corre-sponded well with those obtained separately. In most cases, analyses were made from a series of confocal Z-sections taken parallel to the long axis of the GA at the time interval specified in some cases as identified in the text or figure legends , analyses were made from continuous observations at the midsagittal Z-plane. Photomicroscopy and electron microscopy of fixed material VNCs were fixed for 2â3 hours in 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, or in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 at room temperature and postfixed for 1â2 hours in 2% OsO4 in the same buffer. All fixed tissue was dehydrated, embed-ded, sectioned, and viewed as previously described Ball-inger et al., 1997 . No differences were noted for tissues fixed in either buffer. Dye injection and epifluorescence microscopy VNCs were pinned to a Sylgard-coated dish, and MGAs were impaled with glass microelectrodes. The tips of the electrodes were filled with 2% Lucifer Yellow CH, lithium salt Molecular Probes in dechlorinated water. The shafts of the electrodes were filled with 100 mM LiCl. Lucifer Yellow was iontophoresed into MGAs with 10â50 nA hyperpolarizing current pulses of 200 ms duration deliv-ered at 3â4 Hz for 10â20 minutes. Following injection, VNCs were kept for 1 hour at room temperature to allow the dye to diffuse. VNCs were then fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 for 8â12 hours at 8â10Â°C. After fixation, VNCs were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, cleared in methyl salicylate, and placed on a coverslip in a drop of methyl salicylate. This whole mount was illuminated epifluores-cently, and MGA neurites were photographed with a Zeiss CM 45 inverted microscope. Neurite diameter was deter-mined by averaging three diameters taken at random points along the neurite. Neurite volume was calculated by assuming that neurites were cylindrical in shape. Nomenclature To assist our description of dynamic morphological fea-tures in DIC and confocal images, we defined three spatial regions of interest in intact and transected GAs. Since the axolemma can be distinguished from the myelin layers in electron micrographs, but not in DIC or confocal images, we lumped the FM-labeled myelin sheath together with the axolemma into a single identifiable SH region in confocal images. [Myelin in earthworms is sometimes re-ferred to as ââpseudomyelinââ or ââinvertebrate myelinââ be-cause its biochemistry is somewhat different from verte-brate myelin and its layers are more loosely packed than mammalian myelin Roots and Lane, 1983 ]. In DIC and confocal images, we identified features in the subaxolem-mal S-Ax region of axoplasm separately from those located in the core C-Ax region of axoplasm. The S-Ax region was defined to extend from 0 to 10 Î¼m from the axolemma or dye barrier. The C-Ax region was defined as the region that began 10 Î¼m interior to the axolemma or dye barrier in intact axons or to the dye barrier in severed axons Fig. 1BâH . In this paper, various procedures and assessments were often performed on earthworms whose GAs were transec-ted in calcium-free salines at intervals of 5 to ,10, 10 to ,20, 20 to ,35, and 35 to 60 minutes PC. These proce-dures and assessments were usually done early in the interval for all times except for 35â60 minutes, during which interval assessments were made at any time. For simplicity, we refer to these intervals as 5, 15, 25, and 35â60 minutes PC, respectively. In some cases particu-larly for GAs observed at 5 hoursâ10 days PT , GAs were cut in physiological salines containing calcium. In such cases, PC times are designated as PT times. We Blan-chette et al., 1999 have recently determined that calcium entry at cut axonal ends, rather than injury per se, initiates the sequence of events associated with the forma-tion of dye diffusion barriers, i.e., that PC and PT times are equivalent. DISCUSSION Characteristics common to dye barriers in earthworm MGAs or other preparations Previous ultrastructural data Ballinger et al., 1997 and our current confocal data suggest that multilayered membranous structures in transected myelinated earth-worm MGAs arise by myelin delaminations sometimes associated with axolemmal invaginations. Our present data now show that dye barriers in MGAs always have three characteristics once they reliably form at 15 minutes PT or PC. First, dye barriers are always located amid an accumulation of membranous structures. Second, dye bar-riers are always sharply defined ,2 Î¼m wide . Third, dye barriers are always coincident for internal vs. external dye barriers. In contrast, there is little or no myelin delamina-tion, and dye barriers do not form if MGAs are transected in Ca21-free saline. Although these three characteristics common to earth-worm MGA dye barriers are also common to dye barriers that form following damage to the plasmalemma of other preparations, the origin, ultrastructure, and mechanism of formation of the membranous structures and time of dye barrier formation can greatly differ in different prepara-tions. For example, dye-diffusion barriers in lesioned, unmyelinated, crayfish MGAs and unmyelinated squid giant axons bathed in exogenous calpain form within 10â60 minutes amid an accumulation of single-layered membranous structures that arise from the axolemma by endocytosis or from double-layered structures that prob-ably have a glialemmal origin Eddleman et al., 1997, 1998 Godell et al., 1997 . In contrast, following plasmalem-mal lesions of sea urchin eggs, a dye-diffusion barrier forms within seconds amid, or exterior to, preformed vesicles docked at or near the plasmalemma Steinhardt et al., 1994 Terasaki et al., 1997 . As we report for the earthworm MGA, in all these other preparations, new membranous structures and or dye barriers do not form if the plasmalemma is damaged in Ca21-free salines Krause et al., 1994 Steinhardt et al., 1994 Bi et al., 1995 Eddleman et al., 1997, 1998 Godell et al., 1997 Terasaki et al., 1997 . All these data are consis-tent with the hypothesis that elevation of intracellular Ca21 by entry through the injury site, rather than plasma- lemmal damage per se, induces the formation of new membranous structures Eddleman et al., 1998 . Further-more, comparisons of PT vs. PC data Blanchette et al., 1999, personal observations suggest that dye barrier formation and the dynamic changes in the dye barrierâ see next section is initiated by Ca21 entry, rather than plasmalemmal damage. Dynamic changes in the structure of the dye barrier in earthworm GAs Although dye barriers that form at any PT or PC time have three common characteristics, as described above, we now report for the first time for any preparation that a dye barrier can be very dynamic with respect to its location, configuration, and relation to various membranous struc-tures. For example, the dye barrier for earthworm MGAs continuously moves inwardly with respect to the cut end from 15 to 35 minutes PT or PC and then remains stationary for at least 25 minutes thereafter. The dye barrier is usually very convoluted at 15â25 minutes PC and is usually less convoluted thereafter. The dye barrier often forms amid an accumulation of membranous struc-tures whose largest diameters are much smaller at 10 minutes than at .35 minutes PT or PC. The dye barrier is usually just interior to a set of larger 10â30 Î¼m membra-nous structures at 15 minute PC and just exterior to those structures at 25 minutes. The barrier then maintains a more constant morphology and position for the next 12â24 hours. From 1 to 3 days PT, the membranous axoplasmic structures once associated with the barrier then disap-pear, and neurites grow out from the cut end whose axoplasm and glial sheath are morphologically similar to intact axons. As yet, we have no good functional explanation for why the dye barrier might undergo such structural changes, although we suspect that the final stable configuration is associated with an ability to form a barrier to substances smaller than fluorescent dyes of 400â10,000 daltons. That is, our present data show that the barrier to dye diffusion in earthworm MGAs forms sooner ,15 minutes PT or PC than does a previously reported barrier to ionic injury currents 30â60 minutes Krause et al., 1994 . Such an accumulation of membranous structures somehow forms a dye barrier by fusing to produce a continuous membrane, forming junctional complexes, and or by packing more densely Eddleman et al., 1997 . Nevertheless, whatever its structural basis, our present data show that the dye barrier in earthworm MGAs somehow continues to exclude dyes while it undergoes dramatic structural changes, including the fusion of various membranous structures with the barrier. This dynamic dye barrier at the cut end must somehow interact with a more stable barrier formed by the intact plasmalemma further .30 Î¼m from the cut end. Finally, we note that these data suggest that the dye barrier is not a stable membranous structure, such as might be expected of a partition-like structure Yawo and Kuno, 1983 or the collapse and fusion of severed axolem-mal leaflets Spira et al., 1993 . Regenerating neurites from GA cut ends at 5 hoursâ10 days PT Regenerating neurites are rarely observed at 1 day PT, whereas at 2â10 days PT about half of the proximal or distal stumps of transected GAs exhibit one or more regenerating neurites at the cut end. The cut ends of earthworm GAs contain many abnormal membranous structures prior to 24 hours PT, but not from 1 to 6 days PT. Similarly, myelin delaminations are often observed in severed GAs prior to 24 hours PT but rarely observed from 1 to 6 days PT or in control GAs. These data suggest that regenerating neurites arise from the cut ends of the proximal or distal stumps of transected GAs only after the morphology of the axon at the cut end is similar to that of control axons. Our results in vivo differ from those re-ported for severed neurites of Aplysia neurons in tissue culture, in which growth cones form within minutes to hours PT from normal axoplasm proximal to the lesion site where the axoplasm is abnormal Ziv and Spira, 1997 . Our data on the time of formation of regenerating neurites from transected earthworm GAs are consistent with previous reports that about half of all earthworm GAs show functional evidence for regeneration at 7 days PT Birse and Bittner, 1981 and that about half exhibit at least one regenerating neurite within 1 or 2 weeks PT Birse and Bittner, 1981 Lyckman and Bittner, 1992 Lyckman et al., 1992 . We have no evidence for complete degeneration of the proximal or distal stumps of transected GAs for up to 10 postoperative days, consistent with previous reports that both proximal and distal stumps of severed earthworm GAs almost always survive for at least 9 months Birse and Bittner, 1981 Lyckman and Bittner, 1992 Lyckman et al., 1992 . The time of outgrowth of regenerating neurites from severed or crushed proximal stumps has been noted in other in vivo and in vitro preparations. For example, outgrowths arise from severed mammalian PNS axons at 2â10 days PT Ramo Â´n y Cajal, 1928 and at 3â5 days PT from axons in crushed opossum spinal cords maintained in organ culture Varga et al., 1996 . In contrast, regenerat-ing neurites can arise as quickly as 5â30 minutes PT when invertebrate or mammalian axons are severed in tissue culture Wessells et al., 1978 Ashery et al., 1996 Ziv and Spira, 1997 . Sequence of structural and functional changes following GA transection Given the above data, we propose that transected axons, in general, undergo the following sequence of morphologi-cal and functional changes following axotomy 1 an initial phase marked by calcium-induced mobilization of membra-nous structures, which accumulate to form a dye barrier near the cut end 2 a subsequent phase in which such a barrier assessed by dye exclusion or retention undergoes dynamic changes before forming a stable structure and 3 a final phase in which axolemmal continuity is reestab-lished, abnormal membranous structures disappear, and neuritic outgrowths arise from the cut end. For earthworm GAs, in particular, an inflow of calcium ions increases axoplasmic calcium concentration at the cut axonal ends and induces the endocytotic formation of axoplasmic vesicles, as reported for severed crayfish MGAs Eddleman et al., 1997 , and the delamination of myelin layers which protrude into the axoplasm Ballinger et al., 1997 . These and other membranous structures accumu-late at the cut end and form a barrier to dye diffusion within 15 minutes PT Ballinger et al., 1997 Blanchette et al., 1999 and to ionic currents within 60 minutes PT Krause et al., 1994 . The barrier to dye entry is dynamic in that its location and or its morphology of associated membranous structures at the cut end change from 15 to 35 minutes PC. An abnormal accumulation of similar membranous structures remains at the cut end and contin-ues to function as a stable axonal seal for 5â12 hours PT. Between 12 and 24 hours PT, the morphology of the axoplasm, axolemma, and myelin sheath all recover to resemble their morphology in an intact GA. During this time interval, abnormal membranous structures disap-pear and may contribute to the formation of a continuous membrane barrier axolemma , which continues to seal the cut end. Shortly after these changes occur between 1 and 2 days PT , regenerating neurites arise from the continuous axolemma at the cut end. RESULTS Morphology and ultrastructure of control GAs and their glial sheaths As previously reported Gu Â¨nther, 1975 Birse and Bittner, 1981 Hama, 1987 Lyckman et al., 1992 , each somatic segment in the dorsal region of the earthworm VNC contains one MGA cell body and two LGA cell bodies that give rise to one MGAand two LGAs, respectively Figs. 1A, 2A,B . Each MGA or LGA is in electrical contact with the next-most rostral and next-most caudal MGA or LGA at regions of closely apposed membranes, called septa Figs. 1A, 2A . One medial giant fiber MGF , consisting of a series of MGAs, and two lateral giant fibers LGFs , consisting of two series of LGAs, extend for most of the length of the animal Fig. 1A . Each giant fiber GF functions electrically as if it were a single GA Brink and Barr, 1977 . The two LGFs run parallel to, and on either side of, the MGF. In this study, control GAs in adult earthworms were 0.5â1 mm in length. MGAs and LGAs had diameters of about 80â120 Î¼m and 60â80 Î¼m, respectively. The axo-plasm of control unsevered GAs was surrounded by an intact axolemma Fig. 2C . Most of these axoplasmic vesicles were ,1 Î¼m in diameter and located in the S-Ax region within 10 Î¼m of the axolemma. Axoplasmic vesicles or other structures surrounded by multiple layers of membrane were rarely observed in control GAs. At higher magnifications data not shown , microtubules, neurofila-ments, mitochondria, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum were also observed in axoplasm of intact MGAs. Axoplas-mic structure was uniform along the length of a single control GA and was very similar in adjacent GA segments of a GF Fig. 2A . Photomicrographs Fig. 2A and electron micrographs Fig. 2C showed that multiple 50â200 spiral layers of glial cell processes surrounded each MGA to form a myelin sheath 3â10 Î¼m in width, as previously reported Cogge-shall, 1965 Gu Â¨nther, 1975 Roots and Lane, 1983 Hama, 1987 Lyckman et al., 1992 Ballinger et al., 1997 . The concentric layers of glial processes that comprise this invertebrate myelin were more loosely packed than verte-brate myelin and contained some nuclei Fig. 2C , as well as rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, microtu-bules, and other cytoplasmic structures in electron micro-graphs taken at higher magnifications Roots and Lane, 1983 Ballinger et al., 1997 . The myelin layers in earth-worm GAs are held together by desmosomes Fig. 2C , and the innermost glial lamella is attached to the axolemma by transmembrane glycoproteins, as previously reported Roots and Lane, 1983 . The integrity of these desmosomal and axolemmal attachments is calcium dependent Al-berts et al., 1994 . Structural changes in the dye barrier from 15 to 60 minutes PC When hydrophilic dyes are placed in physiological saline or calcium-free saline bathing intact MGAs, the dye is excluded at a barrier that colocalizes with the axolemma Ballinger et al., 1997 . When MGAs are severed in calcium-free saline containing a hydrophilic dye, the MGAtakes up backfills with the hydrophilic dye Fig. 3A . When these MGAs, transected and backfilled in calcium-free salines, were then placed in calcium-containing salines, severed axonal ends formed a barrier that retained the backfilled dye and excluded a second hydrophilic dye added at 10 minutes PC Fig. 4B,C,E,F . To label the axolemma, glia-lemma, and myelin sheath fluorescently, a styryl dye was sometimes added to the saline at the time of transection or at various PC times Fig. 4A,D . When a barrier to the outflow of a backloaded hydro-philic dye formed at 10 minutes PC, the fluorescence boundary indicating a barrier to dye outflow Figs. 3BâI, 4C,F was no more than ,2 Î¼m wide, as estimated in confocal images taken at higher magnification, i.e., at the limit of resolution of our data obtained by confocal micros-copy. The boundary to inflow of a hydrophilic dye Fig. 4B,E placed in the bath saline at 10 minutes PC was also very sharp ,2 Î¼m wide . The two dye boundaries coin-cided Fig. 4B,C and 4E,F and formed amid a tightly packed accumulation of membranous structures 20â40 Î¼m from the cut end at 15 minutes PC Fig. 3C and 50â60 Î¼m from the cut end at 25 minutes PC Fig. 3E âand then remained stationary at 70â80 Î¼m from the cut end when imaged at 35 Fig. 3H or 60 minutes not shown PC. These and other dynamic changes were particularly evident when severed MGAs n 5 6 were backloaded with a hydrophilic dye and then observed by time-lapse confocal microscopy in a single midsagittal Z-section from 5 to 60 minutes PC Fig. 3 . For example, Figure 3AâI shows that the dye barrier remained intact while progressively reced-ing from about 20 Î¼m from the cut end at 5 minutes PC Fig. 3A to about 80 Î¼m from the cut end at 40 minutes PC Fig. 3I . The dye barrier remained intact as it incorpo-rated fused with membranous structures that did not contain the backloaded hydrophilic dye arrows pointing to black voids in Fig. 3 . These sequential time-lapse confocal images showed that some myelin delaminations, similar to those shown in Figure 5B arrows , as far as 100 Î¼m from the cut end evaginate into the axoplasm Fig. 3A, hatched arrow , endocytose to form vesicles, and then migrate to the site of injury to fuse with Fig. 3D,F,G, boxed regions and contribute their membrane to the dye barrier Fig. 3AâI, hatched arrow . These structures often increased in size as invaginations or evaginations Fig. 3AâC, hatched arrow or axoplasmic vesicles Fig. 3DâG, hatched arrow by fusing with similar membranous structures Fig. 3DâF, arrows . These membranous structures became more nu-merous and packed more tightly from 5 to 30 minutes PC Fig. 3AâG . Some structures appeared to bud off from the dye barrier by an endocytotic type process similar to that reported for vesicle formation in unmyelinated crayfish MGAs Eddleman et al., 1998 . Finally, the dynamic barrier at the cut end Figs. 3, 4 appears to be continuous with a stable barrier along the axon further away .30 Î¼m from the cut end that colocalizes with the innermost part of the SH layer, i.e., where the intact axolemma is often observed in electron micrographs data not shown . Membranous structures associated with the dye barrier To describe membranous structures close to ,30 Î¼m the dye barrier, we confocally imaged FM-labeled MGAs n . 20 backfilled with a hydrophilic dye and or exposed to a hydrophilic dye placed in the bath at 10 minutes PC. These MGAs were then confocally imaged for fluorescence in a series of Z-planes not shown and in DIC images acquired at three successive times 15, 25, and 40 minutes PC Fig. 4 . Other MGAs fixed at 40 minutesâ1 hour PC were ultrastructurally examined in longitudinal sections taken through the cut end parallel to the long axis of the axon Fig. 2D,E . Figure 1CâE schematically illustrates our interpretation of some of the following data. At 15 minutes PC, confocal and DIC images showed a rather convoluted dye barrier Figs. 3C, 4AâC almost always formed 20â40 Î¼m from the cut end amid FM-labeled membranous structures almost certainly the my-elin delaminations described by Ballinger et al., 1997 . These FM-labeled myelin delaminations usually occurred in the innermost SH layers but were occasionally observed in the outermost myelin layers data not shown . At 25 minutes PC, the convoluted dye barrier almost always formed about 50â60 Î¼m from the cut end Fig. 3EâG amid FM-labeled protrusions into the S-Ax region data not shown . At 35â60 minutes PC, the dye barrier Figs. 3H,I 4DâF underwent much less change in location or configu-ration and colocalized with many tightly packed, FM-labeled structures 5â10 Î¼m in diameter at 70â80 Î¼m from the cut end Fig. 4DâF . The cut ends of FM-labeled MGAs were not completely covered by myelin layers of the glial sheath at any time from 15 to 60 minutes PC Fig. 4 . Following transection of MGAs in calcium-free saline, electron micrographs Fig. 2D,E of MGAs fixed at 40 minutes PC showed that, within 10 Î¼m of the cut end, the axolemma was disrupted, the myelin sheath somewhat delaminated particularly the innermost layers , and many single-layered and some double-or multilayered membra-nous structures some attached to myelin desmosomes protruded into the axoplasm. Multilayered membranous structures some attached to desmosomal remnants accu-mulated in the axoplasm 30â80 Î¼m interior to the cut end. These structures were very similar to those described for earthworm axons fixed at 1 hour PT Krause et al., 1994 Ballinger et al., 1997 . That is, these multilayered membra-nous structures are almost certainly evaginations of delami-nating myelin that invaginate the axolemma. Membranous structures in the SH and S-Ax region further away .30 Î¼m from the dye barrier were similar to those nearer the dye barrier at all PC times, except that myelin delaminations were less frequent further .30 Î¼m from the dye barrier than closer to it. For example, most of the rather rare delaminations further away from the dye barrier were found in the innermost rather than outermost SH layers Fig. 5A , labeled with FM dyes and rarely filled with backloaded hydrophilic dyes Fig. 5B,D . At 15â60 minutes PT or PC, very few FM-labeled structures maxi-mum diameter 5 10â20 Î¼m were observed in the C-Ax region. Some of these structures filled with a hydrophilic dye placed in the bath Fig. 5D, arrows . At all times PC, the C-Ax region contained relatively few membranous structures compared with the SH or S-Ax regions. Morphology of transected GAs at 5 hoursâ10 days PT GAs protruded slightly ,50 Î¼m from the cut ends of VNCs at 5 hours PT. In contrast, the cut ends of GAs at 12 and 24 hours PT were retracted 50â200 Î¼m inside the cut ends of VNCs. After 24 hours up to 6 days PT, the cut ends of GAs were retracted 100â300 Î¼m inside the cut ends of VNCs. The glial sheath surrounding a GA was open at the cut end in most cases n 5 13 17 at 5 hours PT Fig. 6A , as reported for MGAs at 30â60 minutes PT Ballinger et al., 1997 or PC Fig. 4D . In other words, the parallel layers of myelin lamellae that surrounded an intact GA were sev-ered during GA transection and did not immediately recover the transected end as parallel layers, but instead were extensively delaminated and vesiculated. At 5 hours after surgery, the cut ends of the axon were not covered by a glial sheath consisting of many parallel layers of myelin, rather, the parallel layers of myelin ended some 20â30 Î¼m proximal to the cut end, and the cut end was incompletely covered by many loosely packed membranous structures surrounded by axoplasm Fig. 6A . We call this anatomical arrangement an ââopen glial sheathââ in Table 1. Similarly, the glial sheath was open, i.e., did not completely cover the cut ends, at some n 5 4 10 GAs at 12 hours PT. The glial sheath completely covered the cut ends of other n 5 6 10 GAs at 12 hours PT Fig. 7A,B . We call this a ââclosed glial sheathââ in Table 1. The cut ends of almost all n 5 19 20 GAs at 24 hours PT Fig. 7C and the cut ends of every n 5 33 33 GA examined after 24 hours PT Fig. 7D,E were completely covered by the cut ends of the glial sheath. Based on these and other histological and ultrastructural observations of transected GAs described below, we as-signed the morphology of the cut end of each GA to one of four categories Table 1 . Myelin delaminations, in which glial layers of myelin lamellae had separated from each other and often pro-truded into the axoplasm, were commonly observed at the cut end and along the length of severed GAs at 5 hours PT Fig. 6A,D . Myelin delaminations were typically more severe i.e., there were larger gaps between adjacent layers of myelin lamellae within 100 Î¼m of the cut end than along the rest of a severed GA, as reported for MGAs at 30â60 minutes PT Ballinger et al., 1997 or PC Fig. 2D . Myelin delaminations usually did not continue across septal junctions to adjacent, intact GAs. Delaminations were more severe and more common in myelin layers adjacent to the axolemma than in layers more distant from the axon Fig. 6D . At the cut end, some of these myelin delaminations identified by the presence of desmosomes were completely surrounded by axoplasm and inter-mingled with axoplasmic vesicles and or other membra-nous structures Fig. 6A . Myelin delaminations at 12 hours PT were qualitatively similar to those observed at 5 hours PT, but were less extensive. Myelin delaminations at $24 hours PT were less extensive than those at 12 hours PT, i.e., 39 53 GAs at $24 hours PT contained few or no myelin delaminations Fig. 7F . An abnormal accumulation of vesicles, axolemmal invagi-nations, and or myelin evaginations 1â20 Î¼m in diameter was observed in the axoplasm near the cut end of almost all GAs n 5 16 17 at 5 hours PT Fig. 3A . Serial longitu-dinal sections showed that many of these membranous structures were axoplasmic vesicles, i.e., the membranous structures were completely surrounded by axoplasm. Small ,1 Î¼m in diameter vesicles or other membranous struc-tures were usually electron lucent, whereas large .1 Î¼m in diameter membranous structures often contained some smaller vesicles and or a flocculent material less dense than the surrounding axoplasm. Small axoplasmic vesicles or other membranous structures were typically sur-rounded by a single layer of membrane Fig. 6D a few small axoplasmic vesicles or other abnormal membranous structures were surrounded by two or three membranous layers. Large axoplasmic vesicles or other membranous structures usually had two or more layers of membrane Fig. 6B . Desmosomes were sometimes observed among the abnormal accumulation of membranous structures at the cut end Fig. 6B . [Desmosomes or single or multi-walled membranous structures were almost never seen in control axoplasm Fig. 2 .] A continuous membrane was not discernible amid the abnormal accumulation of axoplas-mic vesicles, myelin delaminations, and other membra-nous structures at the cut end. At 12 hours PT, out of 10 GAs, the axoplasm of 60% contained an abnormal accumulation of axoplasmic vesicles, myelin delaminations, or other membranous struc-tures at the cut end Fig. 7B . In contrast, only 30% of these GAs had only a few membranous structures in the axoplasm, and 10% of these GAs did not contain any membranous structures not found in control GAs. At 24 hours PT, out of 20 GAs examined, the axoplasm near the cut end of only 10% contained an abnormal accumulation of membranous structures. The axoplasm of 30% of these GAs contained a few abnormal membranous structures Fig. 7D , and 60% GAs at 24 hours PT did not contain any abnormal membranous structures Fig. 7C .After 24 hours PT, none of the 33 GAs examined exhibited an accumula-tion of many abnormal membranous structures at the cut end. The axoplasm of 18% of GAs contained a few abnor-mal membranous structures Fig. 7E , and 81% of GAs did not contain any membranous structures not found in control GAs Fig. 7E,F . At any postoperative time, a continuous membrane was not obviously discernible at the cut ends of those GAs that exhibited an abnormal accumulation of membranous struc-tures at their cut ends, i.e., in 16 17 GAs at 5 hours PT Fig. 6A , in 6 10 GAs at 12 hours PT Fig. 7B , and in 2 20 GAs at 24 hours PT. In some cases, axoplasm was present between loosely packed membranous structures at the cut ends of these axons. In contrast, a continuous membrane was easily discernible in sections of GAs that contained few or no abnormal membranous structures i.e., 51 53 GAs at $24 h PT Fig. 7C,D . We did not take serial ultrastructural sections of these GAs to determine whether the axolemma was continuous in all regions at the cut end however, we could discern a continuous axolemma in all sections that were examined. To examine whether the cut ends of MGAs and LGAs remained sealed at 5â12 hours PT, we severed MGAs and LGAs in vivo and then placed them in vitro in physiological saline containing a fluorescent hydrophilic dye at 5 n 5 6 or 12 n 5 5 hours PT. When imaged 15â60 min later see Materials and Methods , the cut ends of all these MGAs and LGAs excluded the hydrophilic dye Fig. 5E , i.e., the cut ends were sealed. Since previous studies have shown that the cut ends of GAs severed in vivo retain an injected hydrophilic dye at 1 dayâ9 months PT Birse and Bittner, 1981 Lyckman et al., 1992 , consideration of all these data suggests that the cut ends of GAs form a barrier to dye diffusion from 15 minutes to 9 months PT. Variability in morphology of transected GAs At all time periods examined from 5 hours to 10 days PT, differences were often observed in the morphology of individual GAs within the same VNC. For example, in a single VNC, the cut end of one GA might be only partially covered by the glial sheath, whereas the cut ends of the other two GAs might be completely covered by the glial sheath. Different GAs within the same VNC also varied with respect to the number and size of membranous structures present in the axoplasm Fig. 7E,F and with respect to the severity of myelin delaminations. There were no significant P , 0.05 differences chi-squared tests for each time period or overall chi-squared test on average between severed MGAs and LGAs with respect to the presence of vesicles or other abnormal membranous structures at the cut end at any PT time. For example, at 24 hours PT, 3 7 5 43% MGAs compared with 9 13 5 69% LGAs exhibited no vesicles or other abnormal membranous structures not found in control GAs. At 6 days PT, 6 10 5 60% MGAs compared with 15 17 5 88% LGAs exhibited no vesicles or other abnormal membra-nous structures not found in control GAs Table 1 . No consistent differences were noted between proximal and distal axonal stumps at any time period for any of the variables examined in this study. In both MGAs and LGAs, both proximal and distal stumps progressed from a state of open sheath with an abnormal accumulation of membra-nous structures at 5 hours PT to a state of closed sheath with few or no abnormal membranous structures at $24 hours PT Table 1 . Regenerating neurites from transected MGAs Neurites were observed to grow out from transected MGAs at 1 day PT equivalent to 1 day PC . Hence, the number, location, and volume see Materials and Methods of regenerating neurites were measured from 1 to 10 days PT in MGAs injected with a fluorescent dye at the time of sampling. All neurites that could be identified n 5 47 were counted Table 2 . Neurite volume was calculated only for those neurites n 5 19 that yielded sharply defined fluorescence images Table 2 . The sharpness of fluorescence images was not affected by the size of the neurite and varied greatly between different MGAs in whole mount. In all cases, neurites arose from the end of the transected GA, and the boundary to the injected dye was located at the same cut end. Regenerating neurites were observed in 10% of dye-filled MGAs at 1 day PT. At later time periods 2â10 days PT , about half 51% 5 19 37 of dye-filled MGAs had one or more neurites Table 2 . The percent of MGAs with one or more neurites did not change considerably between 2 and 10 days PT. Neurites originated from the cut ends of transected MGAs and ranged in size from 8 to 80 Î¼m in length and from 0.7 to 6.7 Î¼m in diameter. Neurite volume increased dramatically between 2 and 3 days PT but was relatively stable between 3 and 10 days PT Table 2 . [Mean neurite volume was 220 Î¼m3 6 180 SD n 5 13 between 3 and 10 days PT.] Smaller ,50 Î¼m3 neurites Fig. 8A,B were often present in clusters in which two to four neurites originated from the same area of the cut end of an MGA. Larger .50 Î¼m3 neurites Fig. 8C were typically the only process originating from the cut end of an MGA. Although neurites were typically ,3 Î¼m in diameter and usually did not lie in a single plane, one neurite was identified ultrastructurally at the cut end of a severed MGA at 6 days PT Fig. 8D,E . This neurite contained much smooth endoplasmic reticulum and many 0.1â0.3-Î¼m-diameter vesicles Fig. 8D,E , similar to those reported for growth cones in other preparations Ziv and Spira, 1997 . At higher magnifications data not shown , most of these vesicles had a single layer of membrane.

J. Comp. Neurol. 416 398â415, 2000. r 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. The neurotrophins are a family of secreted polypeptides that include nerve growth factor NGF , brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF , neurotrophin-3 NT-3 , and neurotrophin 4 5 NT-4 5 . These factors support the prolif-eration, survival, and differentiation of specific popula-tions of neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems PNS, CNS Barde, 1989 Davies, 1994 Snider, 1994 Conover and Yancopoulos, 1997 Reichardt and Farin Ëas, 1997 McAllister et al., 1999 . In addition to their well-characterized roles during development of the PNS, neurotrophins are also present in the adult CNS. They are believed to be important in maintaining a neuronal differ-entiated phenotype and may play a role in synaptic plasticity, for example, during memory formation or follow-ing seizures Thoenen, 1995 Lewin and Barde, 1996 Schuman, 1999 . Two types of neurotrophin receptors exist tyrosine kinase receptors Trk Barbacid, 1994 and a ââlow affinityââ p75 receptor Chao, 1994 . The three Trk receptors, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, appear to transduce most of the biological effects of the neurotrophins. The Trk receptors show some selectivity for the different neurotrophins. TrkA is a recep-tor for NGF and NT-3 and NT-4 5 with lower efficacy , TrkB is a receptor for BDNF and NT-4 5 and NT-3 at lower efficacy , and TrkC is a receptor for NT-3 Eide et al., 1993 Barbacid, 1994 . Many in situ hybridization and RNA blot experiments have detected the presence of neurotrophin and trk recep-tor transcripts during development as well as in adult rat brain and peripheral tissues. The onset of embryonic expression of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 reportedly coincides with the onset of neurogenesis E11â12 in the rat Maison- pierre et al., 1990 . The different neurotrophin mRNAs have different distributions and are expressed in varying amounts during development. NT-3 is the most highly expressed neurotrophin in immature regions of the CNS and its expression decreases dramatically with matura-tion of the brain. The highest level of NT-3 mRNA in the rat CNS occurs shortly after birth, whereas maximal amounts of BDNF and NGF mRNAs were observed 2 and 3 weeks postnatally Ernfors et al., 1990a,b Maisonpierre et al., 1990 Friedman et al., 1991 Lauterborn et al., 1994 . NT-4 5 mRNA was maximal at E13, decreased around birth, then rose again Timmusk et al., 1993 . In the adult rat brain, the hippocampus and cerebellum contain the highest levels of NT-3 mRNA Maisonpierre et al., 1990 Rocamora et al., 1993 . In the hippocampus, NT-3 mRNAis present in the dentate gyrus, CA2, and medial CA1 regions Ernfors et al., 1990b Phillips et al., 1990 Friedman et al., 1991 . In the cerebellum, NT-3 mRNA is present in the internal granule cell layer Rocamora et al., 1993 . NT-3 mRNA was detected in the cingulate cortex and hilar region of the hippocampus only during the first 2 weeks of age Friedman et al., 1991 . NT-3 mRNA was also detected at lower levels in the induseum griseum, tenia tecta, and in the brainstem ventral to the fourth ventricle and medial to the locus coeruleus Ernfors et al., 1990b . Initially, due to the absence of specific neurotrophin antibodies for measurement of protein levels, studies of neurotrophin expression measured neurotrophin mRNA levels. However, more recently, the distribution of NT-3 protein in the rat has been described using specific anti-NT-3 antibodies in enzyme immunoassays Murase et al., 1994 So Â¨derstro Â¨m and Ebendal, 1995 and in immunocyto-chemical studies Zhou and Rush, 1994 Katoh-Semba et al., 1996 Friedman et al., 1998 . These studies report the presence of NT-3 in the islands of Calleja, olfactory pri-mary cortex, septum including the diagonal bands of Broca , amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, bed nu-clei of the stria terminalis, cerebellum, mesencephalic trigeminal nuclei, and motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord Zhou and Rush, 1994 So Â¨derstro Â¨m and Eben-dal, 1995 Katoh-Semba et al., 1996 Friedman et al., 1998 . There is partial agreement between the in situ hybridization studies of NT-3 expression and immunocyto-chemical detection of NT-3 in that the most prevalent expression is seen in the hippocampus and cerebellum. However, discrepancies between these studies have been suggested as evidence for anterograde and or retrograde transport of NT-3. Although mutant mice are proving useful in the analysis of NT-3 function, only a few reports of NT-3 expression in this species have been published. Regional distribution of NT-3 was described using an immunoassay Kaisho et al., 1994 Katoh-Semba et al., 1998 and found to be similar to that described for the rat. In this study, we have used a transgenic mouse strain, NT-3lacZneo,where the coding region for NT-3 is replaced by lacZ, the Escherichia coli gene coding for the enzyme, b-galactosidase. We have performed histochemistry and immunocytochemistry to localize b-galactosidase in mice heterozygous for this null mutation. A comparison of our results with previous in situ hybridization studies shows that histochemical detection of b-galactosidase has a higher signal-to-noise ratio and is more sensitive than in situ mRNA hybridizations as a method to identify cells expressing NT-3. This has allowed us to detect early sites of expression not previously described, such as granule cell precursors in the dentate gyrus and early piriform cortex cells. In addition, this approach has enabled us to note that the cells of the induseum griseum and fasciola cinereum FC are derived from one group of NT-3-expressing cells. In order to further identify which cell types express NT-3, we have performed double-labeling experiments using combined histochemistry and immunocytochemistry to simultaneously localize b-galactosidase and neuropep-tides, neurotransmitters, or calcium-binding proteins. Be-cause b-galactosidase is a cytosolic molecule and NT-3 is a secreted protein, this mouse cannot be used to draw conclusions as to where NT-3 is transported. However, this transgenic approach is complementary to immunocyto-chemistry with anti-NT-3 antibodies. This is because we detect cells in which NT-3 is presumably made, whereas the antibodies detect where the NT-3 protein accumulates. By using the NT-3lacZneo mouse strain, Farin Ëas et al. 1996 described NT-3 expression relating to development of the PNS. By using a similar transgenic mouse, Tojo et al. 1995, 1996 described NT-3 expression relevant to the developing PNS and postnatal cerebellum. We report here our studies on the sites of NT-3 expression in both the developing and adult mouse forebrain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of NT-3 lacZ mice All animal procedures were approved by the University of Colorado Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to NIH guidelines. Transgenic NT-3lacZneo mice were gener-ated previously by one of the authors by using homologous recombination of a targeting construct into embryonic stem cells Farin Ëas et al., 1994 . The construct used has the b-galactosidase translation initiation codon replacing the NT-3 start codon as shown in Figure 1 of Farin Ëas et al. 1994 . The entire protein coding region of NT-3 has been replaced by the lacZ gene, creating a null mutation. Mice were backcrossed to C57BL 6J and animals used in this study had undergone at least seven generations of back-crossing. Mice were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction PCR . One PCR primer SV403P GTGGTTTGTC-CAAACTCATC was located in the SV40 polyadenylation signal 38 of the lacZ gene, and the other primer was located in the PGK promoter of the neomycin resistance gene PGK-2 GTGCCAGCGGGGCTGCTAAAGCGC . PCR was carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin with 50 Î¼M dNTPs and 1 Î¼M primers. PCR conditions were 35 cycles with 1 minute denaturation at 94Â°C, 30 seconds annealing at 61Â°C, and 2 minutes elonga-tion at 72Â°C. Staining of postnatal pups and adult brains Adult mice or pups older than P5 wild-type or NT-3 heterozygotes were anesthetized with 20 Î¼l g 2.5%Avertin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 100% Avertin is 10 g tribromoethanol, 10 ml tert-amyl alcohol . Neonates were anesthetized by hypothermia on ice. Mice were perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phos-phate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 1 hour. Brains were cryoprotected overnight in 22% sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4Â°C, then mounted in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound Sakura-Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, CA and stored at -80Â°C until sectioning.

DISCUSSION General We have described our results using a transgenic mouse that had the coding region of the NT-3 gene replaced by the bacterial b-galactosidase gene using gene targeting tech-niques Farin Ëas et al., 1994 . Our results correlate well with NT-3 mRNA localization in the rat brain from previ-ous in situ hybridization studies. Although the sites of expression in the mouse and rat are similar, we also describe sites of NT-3 expression not previously reported in rats. We see expression of b-galactosidase in earlier embryos E9.5 , with expression in the forebrain detect-able at E14.5. Similar to previous studies Ernfors et al., 1990a,b Maisonpierre et al., 1990 Friedman et al., 1991 Lauterborn et al., 1994 , we find that that the overall levels of NT-3 in the brain increase over the first 2 postnatal weeks and then decrease as the animals age. However, although b-galactosidase expression is reduced in older animals, there is still detectable b-galactosidase in the RS cortex of 13 month-old animals. Previous in situ mRNA studies of the rat only found NT-3 mRNA in the cortex of animals up to 5 weeks old Friedman et al., 1991 Lauterborn et al., 1994 . This suggests that histochemical analysis of the NT-3lacZneo mouse is more sensitive than in situ mRNA analysis and detects low expression levels of b-galactosidase.Alternatively, perdurance of the b-galacto-sidase enzyme could be responsible for detection of stain-ing at later ages. However, we have found in the develop-ing cerebellum that cells in the external germinal layer EGL stain intensely with X-gal stain at P0. By P4, however, EGL cells do not stain, suggesting that transcrip-tion of the lacZ gene has stopped and that the enzyme does not remain in these cells for more than a few days. Similarly, in the caudal visual cortex, transient expression was apparent with labeled cells readily apparent at P0 but no X-gal-positive cells were detected at P4. In addition, others report that the half-life of b-galactosidase in neu-rons is approximately 8 hours Pham et al., 1999 . Our studies have used heterozygous animals having one copy of the wild-type NT-3 gene and one copy of the lacZ-disrupted NT-3 gene. Although these animals are viable, reproduce normally, and appear like wild-type animals, some subtle deficits have been reported in mice carrying only one functional copy of the NT-3 gene. These include reduced numbers of dorsal root ganglion cells Airaksinen and Meyer, 1996 , muscle spindles Ernfors et al., 1994 and Merkel cells Airaksinen et al., 1996 , and a failure of sympathetic fibers to branch in the pineal gland ElShamy et al., 1996 . The CNS appears grossly normal in both heterozygous mice and in young homozygous null animals. However, it is possible that heterozygosity for NT-3 alters the pattern of NT-3 expression, and thus of b-galactosidase in the NT-3lacZneo 1 mice. Using this sys-tem, it is also possible that the lacZ gene is expressed ectopically in locations where NT-3 is not normally ex-pressed for example, due to the presence of the PGK promoter of the PGK neo selectable marker used for gene targeting. We cannot completely rule out this possiblility. However, our patterns of X-gal staining are generally very similar to those noted before in the rat using in situ mRNA hybridization, suggesting that ectopic expression of b-ga-lactosidase is likely not occurring. It has been reported that nonspecific b-galactosidase staining can occur in rats Rosenburg et al., 1992 . We have performed controls using wild-type mice and do not see any staining in the brain of these animals Fig. 1 Therefore, we believe that all the X-gal staining we observe directly reflects transcriptional activity of the lacZ gene under control of the NT-3 pro-moter. Studying NT-3lacZneo mice is complementary to detecting NT-3 protein using anti-NT-3 antibodies. Our results indicate which cells transcribe the NT-3 gene, whereas antibodies detect where NT-3 protein has accumulated, including sites to which it has been transported. This is highlighted by our observation that b-galactosidase is expressed in neurons but not in glia, whereas NT-3 is detected immunocytochemically in glia Zhou and Rush, 1994 Friedman et al., 1998 . These observations combined suggest that NT-3 may be taken up by glia but is not synthesized by them. It should be noted that we compare results using our mice with earlier in situ RNA and immunocytochemical experiments primarily carried out in rats. We interpret the identification of cells not previously described as express-ing NT-3 as evidence for increased sensitivity using histo- chemical analysis of b-galactosidase in our mice compared to detection of NT-3 mRNA in the rat brain by in situ hybridization. It is possible that higher levels of NT-3 mRNA accumulate in the mouse brain than in the rat brain, allowing detection of additional cell types. Alterna-tively, it is possible that there are species-specific differ-ences in expression. However, several authors have re-ported quantitation of NT-3 protein in rat and mouse brain regions using enzyme immunoassays or radioimmunoas-says and the overall distribution and amounts of NT-3 protein are similar in the two species Kaisho et al., 1994 Murase et al., 1994 So Â¨derstro Â¨m and Ebendal, 1995 Katoh-Semba et al., 1996, 1998 . The overall pattern of b-galactosidase expression in our mice correlates very well with the pattern of NT-3 expression observed in rats. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of X-gal histochemistry appears higher than than that of in situ hybridization, facilitating the detection of low level-expressing cells. In our transgenic mice, b-galactosidase is expressed in high levels in neurons in the limbic system hippocampus, cortex, and septum . Areas of the limbic system are strongly linked both with each other and with the hippo-campal formation and the anterior nucleus of the thala-mus. In addition, reciprocal connections to and or from the septal area, amygdaloid complex, and hypothalamus are important connections of the limbic system. Areas of the limbic cortex cingulate, RS, piriform, entorhinal have many connections with sensory, motor, and associational cortices. The limbic structures are ideally placed to inte-grate signals from the internal and external worlds. The presence of NT-3 in the limbic system suggests that it may have important functions in complex behaviors such as memory, learning, and social and emotional behaviors. Recent observations showing that neurotrophins regulate synaptic transmission are particularly interesting in this context. NT-3 has been shown to have both rapid and long-term effects on synaptic strength Schuman, 1999 . Hippocampus The hippocampal formation and its associated supracal-losal induseum griseum and anterior tenia tecta rudi-ments are considered to be the central cortical components of the limbic system these areas all contain high levels of b-galactosidase. b-galactosidase levels are particularly high in dentate granule cells, in pyramidal cells around the CA2 CA3 border, and in FC cells. In the adult, at least 95% of the dentate granule cells are stained with X-gal and a paler blue stain can be seen in the dendrites. The axons of granule cells, called mossy fibers, project to CA3 pyrami-dal cells. During the second postnatal week, the mossy fibers are also intensely stained, but this stain is lost as the animal matures, suggesting that the expression of the NT-3 gene declines. Granule cells of the dentate gyrus are formed much later in development than the other cells in the hippocampus. Dentate granule cells form prenatally and perinatally in the dentate neuroepithelium situated around the dentate notch, a ventricular indentation Altman and Bayer, 1990a . These cells then migrate to the dentate gyrus. In the first 2 postnatal weeks, the major site of dentate granule cell production switches to the tertiary germinal matrix situ-ated in the inner portions of the V-or U-shaped limbs of the dentate gyrus in what will become the hilus or polymorph layer Altman and Bayer, 1990b . During the postnatal period P3â10 in the rat , most of the dentate granule cells are generated and there is an immense increase in the size of the granular layer. By P30, there are very few multiply-ing cells left in the hilar layer. At this point, granule cell production shifts to the subgranular zone, where stem cells continue to produce dentate granule cells at a slow rate throughout the life of the animals Altman and Bayer, 1990a,b Kuhn et al., 1996 . Our results suggest that NT-3 is expressed in dentate granule precursor cells in the primary and secondary germinal matrices prenatally and in the tertiary germinal matrix postnatally. The strong staining throughout the dentate gyrus at older ages pre-cludes determining whether subgranular precursors ex-press b-galactosidase in NT-3lacZneo mice. NT-3 may play several different roles in these early precursors such as a direct survival-promoting role as reported in the PNS ElShamy et al., 1996 or it may act indirectly to keep precursors dividing before differentiating into neurons as described for sensory neurons in the developing PNS Farin Ëas et al., 1996 .Although there are severe reductions in neuron numbers in the PNS of NT-3 mutants, similar profound deficits are not obvious in the CNS of newborn mutants Ernfors et al., 1994 Farin Ëas et al., 1994 . Exces-sive postnatal cell death during cerebellar development has recently been described in a homozygous NT-3 condi-tional mutant Bates et al., 1999 . Thus, more detailed analysis and the use of more refined genetic tools may uncover neurotrophin requirements for NT-3 in other parts of the CNS. Alternatively, there may be more redun-dancy in the CNS with other neurotrophins or growth factors available to compensate when NT-3 is lacking. Analysis of trkB and trkC early postnatal double mutant mice suggests that this may be the case Minichiello and Klein, 1996 , although interpretation of these results is complicated by the poor health of the mutants. Once generated, the dentate granule cells migrate to the two limbs of the horseshoe-shaped dentate gyrus. The earliest generated cells form the outside shell, whereas the more newly formed cells settle beneath them, adjacent to the polymorph layer. At P8 and P11, NT-3 is expressed in all but the innermost youngest cells of the dentate gyrus. At P4, only a small outer layer of cells are X-gal stained. This suggests that the cells express NT-3 at some point after migration to the granule cell layer. Thus, our results indicate that there are two separate waves of NT-3 produc-tion in dentate granule cells an early period of expression in precursor cells and a second period some time after migration of the dentate precursor cells to their final position within the dentate gyrus. Because the second wave of expression occurs after the cells have settled into their final positions, it seems likely that NT-3 is not involved in the final migration of dentate granule cells. The second wave of NT-3 expression coincides with the arrival of perforant path axonal fibers from the entorhinal cortex, which begin to reach the dentate gyrus around E19.5 Supe `r and Soriano, 1994 . Therefore, perhaps spe-cific innervation and synapse formation by perforant path fibers on dentate granule cells trigger the second wave of NT-3 expression and it is involved in the formation or function of these synapses. NT-3 is expressed in some hippocampal pyramidal cells, most of which are in the CA2 region, but some of the stained cells appear to be in the CA3 region. CA2 cells were originally defined by Lorente de No Â´ 1934 as a narrow region of large pyramidal cells between small CA1 and large CA3 cells, but they differ from CA3 cells in that they do not receive mossy fiber input. X-gal staining occurs mostly in CA2 cells. However, some of the X-gal-stained cells appear to receive mossy fiber input, indicating that they are CA3 cells Figs. 1k and 2h . We have observed this in P11 animals, in which the mossy fibers are X-gal stained, and in the adult, in which mossy fibers stained with anti-calbindin antibodies reach some X-gal-stained pyramidal cells. There has been considerable controversy over whether CA2 represents a separate classification of cells or whether they are a continuation of distal CA3 cells, but there are increasing reports of molecular distinctions between these populations. CA2 cells have denser acetylcholinesterase staining and there is denser parvalbumin staining Ama-ral and Witter, 1995 . Also, basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF is specifically expressed in about one-fourth of the CA2 cells Emoto et al., 1989 Williams et al., 1996 , whereas all CA2 cells specifically bind the antibody Tor-23, which was raised against Torpedo cholinergic synapto-some preparations Stephenson and Kushner, 1988 . It will be interesting to see if NT-3 is in the same or an overlapping set of cells as these other markers. The fact that only a subset of pyramidal cells contain NT-3 suggests a functional distinction. One functional difference that has already been noted within the hippocampus is that CA2 cells are particularly resistant to cell damage in epilepsy. Sloviter 1989 pro-posed that this is due to accumulation of higher levels of calcium-binding proteins. Because NT-3 is expressed in these cells, it is possible that NT-3 may protect them. There is in vitro data suggesting that NT-3 can protect cultured hippocampal cells from ischemic damage Cheng and Mattson, 1994 , but it is not known if this occurs in vivo. On the whole, other than mossy fiber input, CA2 cells share the same connections as CA3 cells Amaral and Witter, 1995 . However, there is a prominent input to CA2 cells from the supramammillary area Haglund et al., 1984 . It is also interesting that we find NT-3 expression in the supramammillary region of the hypothalamus. In the same way that expression of NT-3 in the CA2 CA3 region of the hippocampus suggests the presence of a functionally distinct subset of cells, the lack of X-gal stain in a subset of cells located between the PrS and RS cortex implies that these unstained cells differ from either PrS or RS cells. These cells lacking b-galactosidase may indicate the presence of the postsubiculum as a distinct structure from the dorsal PrS. The receptor for NT-3, TrkC, is present on CA1, CA2, and CA3 pyramidal cells as is NT-3 immunoreactivity Tessarollo et al., 1993 Lamballe et al., 1994 Zhou and Rush 1994 Friedman et al., 1998 . In addition, TrkC receptors also occur on dentate granule cells Tessarollo et al., 1993 Lamballe et al., 1994 . Interestingly, NT-3 immu-noreactivity occurs only in the dorsal dentate granule cells in rats Zhou and Rush, 1994 . This suggests that a similar rostrocaudal gradient of expression of NT-3 is present in both rats Friedman et al., 1991 Zhou and Rush, 1994 and in our mice. Because NT-3 is also synthesized in many cell types of the hippocampus, there are many possible ways that NT-3 could be retrogradely or anterogradely trans-ported. For example, NT-3 protein in CA3 cells Zhou and Rush, 1994 could arise by anterograde transport from dentate granule cells via their mossy fibers. It should be noted that NT-3 is promiscuous in its action on Trk receptors. Although TrkC is the preferred receptor, NT-3 also acts on TrkA and TrkB receptors Chao, 1992 . Be- cause full-length kinase-domain containing trkB is ex-pressed in all subregions of the hippocampus Valenzuela et al., 1993 , this adds many more ways for NT-3 to affect hippocampal cells. High levels of NT-3 are present in the induseum griseum and tenia tecta. These structures are supracallosal indu-seum griseum and anterior tenia tecta rudiments of the hippocampus. They are central components of the limbic system with connections to the cingulate, RS, and entorhi-nal cortices Lopes da Silva et al., 1990 . Our results demonstrate that the cells in the induseum griseum are related to the cells of the FC. During development, the fibers of the corpus callosum divide a single population of NT-3-expressing cells into these two cell groups Fig. 4f,g . There have not been many previous studies of FC cells, but they, like induseum griseum and CA2 cells, contain bFGF as determined by mRNA in situ hybridization Emoto et al., 1989 . Immunocytochemical localization of bFGF shows that labeled cells form the same topography as NT-3-labeled cells. The medial band of FC cells and the lateral band of CA2 cells converge rostrally to form a single band of pyramidal neurons across the dorsal hippocampus Wil-liams et al., 1996 . NT-3 and bFGF are expressed in the same cell populations, suggesting that they are regulated by the same mechanisms or that the transcription of one may be dependent on the presence of the other. It would be interesting to determine whether there is altered expres-sion of bFGF in mice lacking NT-3 or vice versa. Our double-label results suggest that NT-3 is expressed in a subset of hilar interneurons including those express-ing parvalbumin, GABA, NPY, and VIP. Interestingly, another group found that about 16% of parvalbumin-positive cells in the rat hippocampus also showed hybrid-ization for NT-3 mRNA, most of these cells being within or close to the pyramidal layer Rocamora et al., 1996 . The fact that NT-3 appears to be expressed in many different interneuron types, but only in a subset of the cells express-ing any one of these markers, is consistent with the apparent very high physiological and pharmacological diversity of interneuron types Parra et al., 1998 and indicates that they may also have diverse neurotrophin expression characteristics. Cortex The periarchicortex PrS, postsubiculum, PaS, entorhi-nal cortex and adjacent perirhinal cortex, infralimbic cortex, and parts of the RS and cingulate cortices forms the peripheral component of the limbic system Lopes da Silva, 1990 . The cortical areas that contain the most NT-3 are all considered to be part of the limbic system hippocam-pus, subicular complex, piriform, entorhinal, cingulate, RS, insular, and orbital cortices . NT-3 is expressed in these cortical areas at different time points. In the entorhi-nal cortex, NT-3 expression is first apparent at P4 and yet cells in the entorhinal cortex are all generated embryoni-cally Bayer, 1980 . This late onset of NT-3 expression may therefore indicate a role for NT-3 in synaptogenesis or synapse function in these cells. In the neocortex, full-length and truncated TrkC recep-tors are located in layers II, III, V, and VI Tessarollo et al., 1993 Valenzuela et al., 1993 Lamballe et al., 1994 . NT-3 immunoreactivity has been reported primarily in cell bodies and dendrites of pyramidal cells of layers III and V of the primary olfactory, somatosensory, cingulate, and visual cortices and in the claustrum in the rat Zhou and Rush, 1994 . In piriform, entorhinal, cingulate, and visual cortices, NT-3 may act in an autocrine fashion in cells within layers II and III with a possible paracrine action on cells in the deeper layers of the cortex. The most likely sources of NT-3 for much of the neocortex are either the scattered interneurons located in the deep layers through-out the cortex or in the more abundant expression found in areas of the limbic cortex piriform, entorhinal, cingulate, and RS . We find a transient perinatal expression of b-galactosi-dase in the caudal visual cortex mostly in layers II and III, demonstrating that expression of b-galactosidase marker, and presumably of NT-3, can be quite dynamic. We also find that expression of b-galactosidase in V2M continues through adulthood, suggesting that NT-3 may play first a transient role, then a persistent role in the visual cortex. It is interesting to consider this expression of NT-3 in the context of reports of the ability of NT-3 to modulate the morphology of visual cortical neurons in cultured slices McAllister et al., 1997 . Others report that the expression of NT-3 mRNA in the visual cortex was increased when rats were housed in stimulating housing conditions Toras-dotter et al., 1996 . This suggests that in cells where NT-3 is persistently expressed in the adult, the levels may be altered by the environment. Septum The septal area is also part of the limbic system. In the septum, the SHi expresses high levels of b-galactosidase. This nucleus is considered to be part of the anterior hippocampal rudiment, along with the tenia tecta. In addition, there is b-galactosidase in the lateral septum. The lateral septum has extensive afferent connections from the hippocampus CA1, CA3, and subiculum , entorhi-nal cortex, hypothalamus, and brainstem and projects to medial septal nucleus, nuclei of the diagonal band, lateral hypothalamus, and mammillary complex Swanson, 1977 Swanson et al., 1987 . The majority of efferents from the septum to the rest of the limbic system come from the medial septum and diagonal bands of Broca. There are also smaller efferent projections from the lateral septal nuclei to the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, infralimbic cortex, and tenia tecta Jakab and Leranth, 1995 . Thus, the lateral septum is interconnected with many other areas of the limbic system that contain NT-3. There are TrkC receptors at least in developing medial septal areas Lam-balle et al., 1994 . Immunoreactive NT-3 has been found in the diagonal bands of Broca Zhou and Rush, 1994 , suggesting that NT-3 may be retrogradely transported there from the hippocampus dentate gyrus or CA2 or anterogradely transported from the subicular complex, entorhinal cortex, or lateral septal area. Thalamus The reuniens nucleus and anterior nuclei of the thala-mus are considered part of the limbic system and both have reciprocal connections with the hippocampus Lopes da Silva et al., 1990 . Areas of the limbic cortex cingulate, RS, infralimbic have reciprocal connections with the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. In the adult, there is X-gal staining in a midline nucleus and it has been earlier noted that the entorhinal cortex receives input from several midline nuclei Lopes da Silva et al., 1990 . The LHb are believed to act as a functional interface between limbic and motor systems and a way for the limbic system to influence brainstem reticular formation. This is because they receive inputs from the globus pallidus, lateral hypo-thalamus, lateral preoptic area, nuclei of the diagonal band, ventral tegmental area, and midbrain raphe and central gray and they project to the reticular formation Herkenham and Nauta, 1977 . In the adult, therefore, X-gal staining is apparent in thalamic areas LHb, MD, and VRe nuclei associated with the limbic system. During development, especially around P11, there is extensive staining in many thalamic nuclei including several of the classic relay and associational nuclei. Our results correlate with in situ mRNA studies by Lauterborn et al. 1994 who found similar extensive transient expres-sion in many thalamic relay nuclei during development. This suggests that NT-3 plays a role in the limbic system during adulthood, whereas during development, it is in-volved in other thalamic functions. Hypothalamus There is very little hypothalamic stain, other than small amounts in the mammillary bodies, which are part of the Papez circuit transferring information from the hippocam-pus to the mammillary bodies to the anterior thalamus to the hippocampus Papez, 1937 . It is interesting to note that there is X-gal stain present in all the areas involved in the Papez circuit, but not all cells in all areas are stained. Therefore, we cannot say whether NT-3-expressing neu-rons consistently project directly to other NT-3-expressing neurons within the circuit. Amygdala NT-3, as measured by expression of b-galactosidase, is present in many of the areas that are involved in the limbic system, but there is one conspicuous exception the amyg-dala contained no detectable b-galactosidase other than in the posterolateral and posteromedial cortical amygda-loid nuclei . Yet, the amygdala is a major component of the limbic system. High levels of NT-3 protein have been detected using immunocytochemistry in the rat amygdala Zhou and Rush, 1994 . TrkC receptors are expressed in the amygdala, habenular nuclei, hypothalamus, and cor-tex Lamballe et al., 1994 . Therefore, for NT-3 protein to function in the amygdala, it would have to either be transported to the amygdala anterogradely from the hypothalamus, piriform, orbital, or anterior cingulate cor-tices or retrogradely from the hypothalamus, septum, habenular nuclei, orbital, piriform, or anterior cingulate cortices via the axons of amygdalar neurons that project to these areas . Studies of NT-3 expression and TrkC distribu-tion cited above have been carried out in rats and there may be differences in the mouse. Basal ganglia trkC transcript levels are high in the striatum through-out development and in the adult Tessarollo et al., 1993 , which would suggest a role for NT-3 in the development and function of the basal ganglia. However, NT-3 is not synthesized in the striatum in detectable levels our data and Ernfors et al., 1990b Lauterborn et al., 1994 . NT-3 is synthesized in cells of the substantia nigra Seroogy and Gall, 1993 and Fig. 3e . We find X-gal colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in a subset of cells. It is possible that NT-3 is transported to the striatum anterogradely in the nigrostriatal path and perhaps retro-gradely in the striatonigral path in the mouse. Other potential sources of NT-3 for the striatum include the thalamus and layer III cells of the cingulate and RS cortices. NT-3 expressed in the substantia nigra or cortex and transported to the basal ganglia could be involved in supporting striatal neuron differentiation and survival, as reported to occur in vitro Widmer and Hefti, 1994 Venti-miglia et al., 1995 Nakao et al., 1996 or it could affect functioning of the adult striatum Martin-Iversen et al., 1994 . Summary We have demonstrated the utility of the NT-3lacZneo mouse in determining the localization of NT-3-expressing cells in the developing and adult CNS. Our results confirm and extend earlier in situ mRNA studies. In addition, our results complement antibody studies that localize the destination of NT-3 protein in the brain, rather than its site of synthesis. We have made observations of the developing hippocampus that suggest that NT-3 is ex-pressed in granule cells both before and after they have migrated. NT-3 may, therefore, be involved both in the early division of granule cell precursors and later in the formation or modulation of granule cell synaptic contacts. Perhaps the most striking aspect of NT-3 localization in the CNS is its presence in high levels in many components of the limbic system, suggesting that it may play a role in memory and in complex social and emotional behaviors. Indeed, it has been shown that exogenous NT-3 infusion into aged rats can improve spatial memory Fischer et al., 1994 . RESULTS Overview We have localized the expression of b-galactosidase using X-gal staining in the CNS of embryos, neonates, and adult NT-3lacZneo mice, where b-galactosidase is expressed under control of the NT-3 promoter. We found high levels of X-gal reactivity in multiple brain areas of these adult heterozygous mice. Cortical X-gal staining is apparent on both the dorsal Fig. 1a and ventral Fig. 1b views of the brain. In contrast, there is no X-gal staining apparent in a wild type mouse brain Fig. 1c,d . Artifactual staining by X-gal has been reported before in the rat brain Rosenberg et al., 1992 , but we have not noted any artifactual staining in the mouse brain using the tissue processing and stain-ing procedures described. The results shown in Table 1 summarize the localization of b-galactosidase in NT-3lacZneo mouse forebrain on the day of birth P0 , at postnatal day 8 P8 , and in an adult 8 weeks . In general, our results correlate well with previous in situ studies localizing NT-3 mRNA production in the rat Ernfors et al., 1990a,b Maisonpierre et al., 1990 Fried-man et al., 1991 Lauterborn et al., 1994 and with immunocytochemical studies Zhou and Rush, 1994 SoÂ¨der-stro Â¨m and Ebendal, 1995 Katoh-Semba et al., 1996, 1998 Friedman et al., 1998 . The major differences are that we detect X-gal staining in embryonic cortical cells and den-tate gyrus precursors, and in young and aged adult cortices. We believe the high sensitivity of the X-gal staining protocol has allowed detection of sites of expres-sion not previously noted, explaining the differences be-tween our data and prior reports. We report here only on staining observed in NT-3lacZneo heterozygotes. Our exami-nation of staining in NT-3lacZneo homozygote neonates suggests that the pattern of staining is identical but more intense than that seen in heterozygotes. We have further analyzed the cell type specificity of b-galactosidase expression in the adult mouse using immu-nohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Results from these studies show that b-galactosidase is mostly or en-tirely expressed by neurons. For example, b-galactosidase immunoreactivity is colocalized with anti-NeuN immuno-reactivity in the dorsal hippocampus Fig. 2kâm , CA2 Fig. 2nâp , retrosplenial RS cortex Fig. 2qâs , and in the dentate gyrus Fig. 2tâv . NeuN is a neuron-specific pro-tein that is expressed in most, but not all, neurons Mullen et al., 1992 . We found no clear colocalization in the forebrain of X-gal with either GFAP immunoreactivity a marker for astrocytes or with CNPase immunoreactivity a marker for oligodendrocytes . Figure 3 shows the lack of colocalization of X-gal with CNPase immunoreactivity in the RS cortex Fig. 3g and of X-gal and GFAP immuno-reactivity in the dorsal septum Fig. 3h . NT-3 localization in the adult brain Because we have found that the levels of b-galactosidase and therefore presumably NT-3 change throughout the adult life of a mouse, we have used an 8-week-old mouse to describe ââadultââ expression patterns. Olfactory bulb. There is diffuse X-gal staining in fibers of some, but not all, glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. This is due to the expression of b-galactosidase in subsets of olfactory receptor neurons, which is described in detail in Bo Â¨ttger et al. 1999 . Cortex. b-galactosidase is found in several areas of the cerebral cortex in adult mice. The highest levels of labeling are in the cingulate, RS, visual V2M , entorhinal, and piriform cortices Fig. 1 . Lower levels of labeling occur in areas of the orbital, insular, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortex. In the cingulate, staining is heavier in the ventromedial Cg2 area. It continues along the rostrocaudal axis with the granular layer of the RS cortex RSG , which contains more stained cells than the agranular RS cortex RSA Fig. 1eâh . There is also a rostrocaudal gradient of staining, with gradually decreasing stain from the anterior to the posterior cingulate. Upon reaching the RS cortex, there is a more abrupt increase in the staining, increasing further toward the caudal RS cortex. This gradient in the RS cortex is due to more intense X-gal within stained cells and not to a higher proportion of stained versus unstained cells data not shown . The majority of X-gal-stained cells in these cortical areas are in layer III, with fewer stained cells in layer II e.g., the RS cortex in Fig. 1g . There is a band of heavy X-gal stain in the caudal, dorsal cortex just lateral to the cingulate and RS cortices Figs. 1a, 2a . This corresponds to the secondary visual cortex, medial area V2M , although the staining is no longer apparent in the caudal parts of V2M. The stained cells are in layers II and III Fig. 2a . There are also occasional large cells in the deeper cortical layers that are intensely labeled with X-gal arrow-heads in Figs. 1h, 2a . These cells occur in most areas of the cortex including areas where there is no X-gal stain in cells in layers II and III e.g., motor, somatosensory, parietal, auditory, and temporal cortices . Based on the results of combined X-gal and immunocytochemistry, these cells are likely to be interneurons see below . There is intense staining in areas of the piriform cortex. In the piriform cortex, rostrally, X-gal stained cells are located mainly in the dorsal area, whereas more caudally, cells in both the dorsal and ventral areas are stained. These stained cells are mostly located just deep to the dense cell layer, with some stained cells in the dense cell layer. There is a patchy quality of staining apparent Fig. 2b . There are also scattered cells in the deeper cell layers as in other areas of the cortex. In the entorhinal cortex, there are more labeled cells in the medial than in the lateral entorhinal cortex. In the lateral entorhinal cortex, cells in layer III are labeled, whereas in the medial entorhinal cortex, most labeled cells are in layers II and III with a few cells labeled in deeper layers. We performed double-label experiments with X-gal histo-chemistry followed by immunocytochemistry and found scattered cells in layers V and VI in many cortical regions labeled for X-gal and parvalbumin Fig. 2i . We also performed double immunocytochemistry using anti-b-galactosidase and anti-parvalbumin antibodies and found the same pattern of double label as shown in Figure 2j. A few cells were double-labeled for X-gal and somatostatin SS , cholecystokinin CCK , neuropeptide Y NPY , or vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP even fewer cells were double-labeled with X-gal and calbindin, calretinin, or GABA data not shown . All cells double-labeled for X-gal and neuropeptides were located in the deeper layers V and VI of the cortex. The X-gal-labeled cells in layers II and III of the cortex did not show double labeling for any of the neuropeptides, but the scattered X-gal and calbindin or X-gal and calretinin cells were in layer II. Hippocampus. The hippocampus has the most vivid X-gal staining in the forebrain, particularly in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus Figs. 1iân and 2c,d,e,h . Ros-trally, all granule cells in the dentate gyrus showed staining when 7-Î¼m sections were examined at high magnification data not shown . There is lighter blue X-gal stain in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, which likely corresponds to the dendrites of granule cells Fig. 2h . The dendritic staining is only evident at the septal pole, suggesting a higher level of NT-3 expression here than in the more posterior dentate gyrus. There are also scattered stained cells within the molecular layer, espe-cially at the temporal pole Fig. 2c, arrowheads . At the septal pole of Ammonâs Horn, the majority of CA3 cells are X-gal stained. This is shown in a horizontal section Fig. 2d where CA3 cells form a continuous band with FC cells. Also, the labeling of cells at the septal pole Fig. 2e is shown in a coronal section of a P8 brain. The pattern of cell labeling is the same as that for an adult, but the intensity of the X-gal stain is greater at P8 the diffuse dendritic stain is not seen in the adult. Slightly caudal to this, cells across the entire superior limb of the pyramidal cells are stained. Proceeding further caudally, the stain splits so that two cell populations are heavily labeled FC cells medially and a lateral band of cells that corresponds to cells in the CA2 subfield, as well as a few of the adjoining CA3 pyramidal cells Fig. 2f . More caudally still, maximal staining in Ammonâs Horn continues in FC and in cells at the CA2 CA3 border. There are a few stained cells dispersed among the pyramidal cell layers of CA1 and CA3 throughout most of the hippocampus, with more in CA3 at the temporal pole. Throughout the entire rostrocaudal axis, there are a few scattered cells stained in the stratum radiatum and lacunosum moleculaire. There are a few labeled cells in the subiculum, whereas cells in the parasubiculum PaS and the presubiculum PrS are strongly stained as is shown in a horizontal section in Fig. 2c . In the PrS and PaS, many cells in the external principal laminae are stained, whereas only a few cells are stained in the internal principal laminae that are continuous with the subiculum. Dorsally, cells in the PrS form continuous layers with cells of the RSG cortex. However, we find that there is a distinct group of cells between these two structures where there is no X-gal staining in any cell layer. This observation suggests a subpopulation of cells that are distinct with regard to NT-3 expression, but not generally described as distinct anatomi-cally. This population of unstained cells is obvious in a P8 animal when the X-gal stain is intense in the surrounding RS cortex and PrS cells Fig. 2g . There is strong staining in the hippocampal rudiments, the induseum griseum and tenia tecta, where all cells are labeled and there is strong staining in the dendrites for induseum griseum see Figs. 1fâh, 3a,b the tenia tecta [TT] is visible on the ventral surface of the brain in Fig. 1b . We attempted to further define NT-3-expressing cells in the hippocampus using X-gal histochemistry and immuno-cytochemistry. In the adult hilus, only a minor subset of cells express b-galactosidase. We found occasional cells double-labeled for X-gal and parvalbumin, NPY, VIP, and GABA data not shown . The cells double-labeled for X-gal and GABA immunoreactivity are located on the hilar side of the granular layer. Septal nuclei. Strong X-gal staining is present in cells in the septohippocampal SHi Fig. 3a and in dorsal areas of the lateral septal nucleus LSD Fig. 3b . Striatum. There are no stained cells in the striatum. Amygdala. There are stained cells in the posterolat-eral and posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nuclei. No other amgygdaloid nuclei have any stained cells. Thalamus. There is a low level of labeling in the thalamus. There are scattered X-gal-stained cells dorsally in the anterodorsal AD and in the lateral habenular nucleus LHb, Fig. 3c , with lower levels of X-gal stain medially in the mediodorsal MD , intermediodorsal IMD , and central medial CM nuclei and ventrally in the area of the ventromedial VM submedius Sub , and ventral reuniens VRe nuclei. Hypothalamus. There are scattered X-gal-stained cells in several nuclei of the mammillary bodies Fig. 3d . The majority of the staining is seen in supramammillary nuclei, both laterally SuML and medially SuMM . There is less staining in the lateral mammillary nucleus LM , and in the medial mammillary nucleus lateral [ML], medial [MM], and median [MMn] areas . Regardless of the nucleus, the stained cells all lie in an area closely border-ing the principal mammillary tract. Substantia nigra. There are scattered large X-gal-stained cells in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra Fig. 3e . The scattered cells are apparent throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the substantia nigra. The X-gal stain colocalizes with tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactiv-ity in a subset of cells Fig. 3e . b-galactosidase localization in the developing brain General observations. X-gal staining in the embry-onic NT-3lacZneo mouse is first detected at day E9.5 and the intensity of the staining increases during the completion of embryogenesis and into the postnatal period. Each particu-lar area of the brain has a specific time course of NT-3 production.We have noted that overall levels of b-galactosi-dase expression are greatest around the second postnatal week. From then, the X-gal staining decreases in many areas e.g., the cingulate cortex and is lost completely from other areas e.g., most thalamic nuclei . Interestingly, there are changes even during the period when mice are considered adult, so that the X-gal staining decreases between 4 and 8 weeks. There is a further decrease in older animals, particularly in the RS cortex. Thus, even in mature brains, the labeling pattern continues to change. It should be noted that, because of the unknown turnover rate of b-galactosidase in these systems, the timing of any corresponding declines in NT-3 transcription is uncertain based on these observations alone. Olfactory bulb. Most staining in the olfactory bulb is diffuse fiber stain from olfactory receptor neurons but perinatally there are scattered stained mitral cells both in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. Olfactory system staining is described in more detail in Bo Â¨ttger et al. 1999 . Cortex. At E14.5, there is stain in scattered cells of the developing piriform cortex Fig. 4a . Cortical staining increases during development. By E15.5, there are a few labeled cells in the frontal cortex and by E16.5, there is staining in cells in the frontal, insular, cingulate, and RS cortex.At E17.5, cells in the RS cortex are stained more in the RSG than in the RSA , but the staining decreases caudally and there is no entorhinal cortical stain. In the cingulate cortex at E17.5, staining can be seen in cell bodies and there is also diffuse fiber staining in the developing corpus callosum Fig. 4b . By postnatal day P0, there is more cortical staining. Rostrally, cells in the frontal, parietal, and agranular insular cortex are stained. These X-gal-stained cells are in layer III with a dense layer of unstained cells layer II superficial to them. Slightly more caudally, cells in the cingulate and piriform cortices stain. Cells in the cingulate cortex are stained with increasing intensity toward the posterior limit of this cortex. More caudally, there is stain in the RSG and RSA cortices, but there is very little entorhinal cortex stain, which does not appear until P4. There is a faint blue stain in the molecular layer of both the cingulate and RS cortices, which likely corresponds to staining in the dendrites of layer III neurons Fig. 4g . In the caudal visual cortex, there is considerable stain at P0, especially in layers II and less in layer III, but this stain is not apparent by P4. In the rostral parts of the visual cortex, especially V2M, the X-gal stain appears later in development with stain apparent by P8. The staining of cells in V2M remains intense in adulthood, even in a 4.5-month-old animal Fig. 2a . During the second postnatal week, X-gal staining be-comes most intense in most cortical areas. Figure 1eâh shows rostral RS cortical staining in P4, P8, and in 8-week and 4.5-month-old animals. The most intense staining occurs around P8 when cells in layers II and III are labeled and both axons and dendrites of these cells are also stained the dendrites as they ascend to the molecular I layer and the axons as they descend to the white matter as associational and commissural fibers. As the animal ma-tures, the level of staining in the RS cortex decreases. By P22, staining is no longer apparent in the processes, but cell bodies in layer III are heavily stained. The staining in cell bodies decreases as the animal grows older Fig. 1g . By 4.5 months, X-gal staining in layer III cells in the RS cortex is barely detectable, but there are still heavily labeled cells scattered in the deeper layers Fig. 1h, arrowheads . By 18 months, there is no detectable X-gal staining in layers II and III of the RS cortex. A rostrocau-dal pattern of X-gal staining is also apparent during development. Although staining is vivid in cells of the rostral RS cortex by P8, cells in the caudal RS cortex are still unstained at this time. However, by P22, the adult pattern is present where cells in the caudal RS cortex have more intense X-gal stain than cells in the rostral RS cortex. The scattered large X-gal-stained cells in the deeper cortical layers in many areas in the adult cortex are not apparent until the animal is mature Fig. 1g . This stain-ing does not decline as the animal ages because these cells are quite apparent at 20 weeks Figs. 1h and 2a, arrow-heads , despite the dramatic decrease in cell staining in layers II and III. These cells are apparent even in an 18-month-old in which there is no staining in cells in layers II and III data not shown . In the entorhinal cortex at P8, staining is more vivid in caudal than in rostral cells. At 20 weeks when very little stain remains in the RS and cingulate cortices, there is still substantial staining in the entorhinal, piriform, and visual V2M cortices Fig. 2a . Even at 18 months, these three cortices show X-gal stain. Hippocampus. We first detected NT-3 expression in the presumptive hippocampus and hippocampal rudi-ments at E14.5 Fig. 4c . A few dentate granule cell precursors are labeled in the primary dentate neuroepithe-lium located just above the dentate notch asterisk in Fig. 4c . By E15.5, there are labeled cells throughout the rostrocaudal axis. At E16.5, there is staining in the dentate gyrus neuroepithelium and in the developing Ammonâs Horn but not in the ammonic neuroepithelium . At E17.5 Fig. 4d , there are still some labeled cells in the primary dentate neuroepithelium, but there are also stained cells in the secondary dentate matrix as well as migrating dentate cells Fig. 4d, arrowhead and dgs . These migrating cells maintain their proliferative activity and are part of the secondary dentate matrix Fig. 4d, dgs Altman and Bayer, 1990a,b . There are still a few labeled cells in the primary dentate neuroepithelium at E17.5. By E19.5, there are very few X-gal-stained cells in the pri-mary dentate neuroepithelium. However, stained cells can be seen migrating and in the secondary matrix Fig. 4e, d,g,s . At E17.5, there are a few X-gal-stained cells in the rostral dentate gyrus and there are many large intensely stained cells in rostral Ammonâs Horn CA1 and CA3 areas Fig. 4d . The stained cells ofAmmonâs Horn are only in the rostral one-third of the hippocampus more caudally, there are only isolated X-gal-stained cells in Ammonâs Horn as well as in the stratum radiatum and lacunosum moleculaire. The staining in dentate gyrus cells also decreases caudally. This correlates with the general gradi-ent of rostrocaudal development of the hippocampus, with rostral structures differentiating first. The hippocampal rudiments, induseum griseum and tenia tecta, both stain vividly throughout development and this stain is intense even at E17.5. There is faint blue staining of dendrites as well as intense cell body stain. At P0, medial FC cells stain strongly and their dendrites can also be seen Fig. 4f , whereas dorsal to the corpus callosum, induseum griseum cells also stain intensely. Proceeding caudally through the P0 brain, the corpus callosum has not yet formed and these two groups of cells FC and induseum griseum form a continuous band Fig. 4g of cells that are morphologically similar and have similar dendritic staining. This same band of cells can be seen in earlier embryos at E17.5 and E19.5 Fig. 4d,e when the corpus callosum has not yet formed. The staining of the hippocampus continues to increase dramatically during the first days of life. At P4, dentate granule cells in the outer portion of the dentate gyrus are labeled with X-gal Fig. 1i . Many more polymorphic hilar cells are X-gal stained at P4 than in the adult compare Figs. 1i,m . At this age, the tertiary intrinsic dentate matrix is positioned in the polymorphic region Altman and Bayer, 1990b . Some of the X-gal-labeled cells may be dentate granule precursor cells. By P8, there is an intense staining pattern in the rostral hippocampus Figs. 1j, 2e .At the septal pole Fig. 2e , CA3 cells are stained and there is diffuse fiber stain that is possibly in mossy fibers of the X-gal-stained dentate granule cells. Many of the dentate granule cell bodies in the rostral hippocampus are X-gal stained Fig. 1j and their dendrites in the molecular layer are stained a paler blue. However, the dentate granule cells in the caudal temporal hippocampus still do not contain NT-3 as mea-sured by X-gal staining. Many more hilar cells are stained at P8 than at P4 Fig. 1i, j . There is diffuse blue stain in both the hilus and the CA3 molecular layer, likely corre-sponding to staining of the dentate granule cell axons mossy fibers . At P11, there are still many hilar cells stained but the numbers have decreased compared to P8 Fig. 1k . In the P11 mouse, the mossy fiber stain is more intense than at P8 Fig. 1j,k axons of the rostral dentate granule cells appear to be stained along their entire length Fig. 1k . By P22, there is vivid homogeneous staining of dentate granule cell bodies throughout the dentate gyrus, includ-ing the caudal end. The staining of cell bodies is intense over 95%, possibly 100% of cells are labeled . There is no longer any diffuse staining in the mossy fibers Fig. 1l , although there is diffuse staining in the granule cell dendrites in the molecular layer. As the animal ages, staining in the dentate granule cells remains intense even at 18 months, but stain in the dendrites is reduced in old animals, suggesting some decline in expression. There are still a few labeled cells in the hilus at P22, but not as many as at P8.Afew scattered X-gal-stained hilar cells remain at 18 months. FC cells are heavily labeled at P22 through adulthood, and stain brightly even in a 4.5-month-old Fig. 1h . Staining of CA2 CA3 pyramidal cells is not apparent at P4. However, staining increases in intensity during the next week so that CA2 CA3 cells stain more intensely at P11 than at P8 Fig. 1j,k .At P11, only the rostral CA2 cells are stained.At P22, the adult pattern is achieved with cells around the CA2 CA3 border in Ammonâs Horn labeling heavily throughout the rostrocaudal axis. Staining in CA2 cells remains strong even in an 18-month-old animal. At the very septal pole of the hippocampus, some CA3 cells stain with X-gal. These rostral cells stain very intensely at P8 and there is also diffuse blue fiber staining Fig. 2e . At P22 and in the adult, there are also X-gal-stained CA3 pyramidal cells at the septal pole, but the stain is less intense than at P8. At P0, there is no X-gal stain in the subiculum or PaS and only a small amount in the PrS. By P4, PrS and PaS cells stain brightly. The pattern seen at P4 continues through adulthood to old age with very little subiculum staining, but bright staining in the PrS and PaS Fig. 2c . Septal nuclei. There is faint staining in the develop-ing septum at E15.5. At E17.5, there is still very little septal stain, but there are some stained cells in the SHi area. At P0, there is staining in the LSD and cells in the SHi are heavily stained. Staining levels continue to in-crease so that by P11, there is much more septal stain than at P8. In the rostral septum, many cells in the lateral septum intermediate and lateral septum ventral are stained and staining in SHi is particularly intense. More caudally, cells in both LSD and SHi are intensely stained. In the older mouse, only LSD and SHi are stained Fig. 3a,b , but these areas show heavy levels of stain even in an aged mouse 18 months . Thalamus. At E15.5, there are stained cells in the thalamic neuroepithelium around the third ventricle. At E17.5, there is some stain in the rostral thalamus around the stria medullaris and habenular area. By P0, the thalamic stain remains faint in scattered cells in the LHb with staining in the anterior thalamus AD, anteroventral [AV], and anteromedial [AM] and medially in the MD. The stain in the thalamus increases so that by P8, cells in several nuclei are stained throughout the thalamus. The pattern of staining at P11 is very similar to that at P8. In the anterior thalamus, many cells in AD and AV dorsome-dial and ventrolateral parts,AVDM andAVVL are stained. Proceeding caudally, cells in LHb, CM, MD, IMD, VM, laterodorsal LD , ventroanterior ventrolateral VA VL , lateroposterior LP and in the posterior thalamic group Po are stained, with less stain in the ventral posterolat-eral ventral posteromedial VPL VPM Fig. 3f . There is ventral thalamic staining surrounding the mammillotha-lamic tract and in the region of the zona incerta ZI , VRe, and Sub nuclei. No staining was detected in the medial or lateral geniculate nuclei. The staining decreases by P22, but there are still cells in AD, AV both AVDM and AVVL , LHb, MD, IMD, VA VL, VM, LP, VPL VPM, and Po. Ventrally, there is staining around the mammillothalamic tract in VM, VRe, and Sub nuclei. By 8 weeks, there is even less thalamic stain, but cells are stained in the LHb, in the medial thalamus MD, IMD, CM , and in ventral thalamus around the mammillothalamic tract in VM, VRe, and Sub nuclei Fig. 3c . Hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has very little X-gal stain at any age. However, at E15.5, there are cells faintly stained in the hypothalamic neuroepithelium. At P0, there are scattered X-gal-stained cells in the mammil-lary bodies. At P8 and P11, stained cells are apparent in the mammillary bodies and ventrally in the area of the arcuate nucleus and median eminence. The stain is still apparent in the mammillary nuclei at 8 weeks Fig 3d , but there are no labeled cells in the arcuate nucleus at this time. Staining in the mammillary bodies continues to be apparent in an aged animal. Substantia nigra. There is no X-gal staining in substantia nigra cells at P0 or P4. The numbers of stained cells increase with age. There are more at P11 than at P8 and this continues to increase until P22 when levels are similar to those of an adult 8-week-old . The stain in the substantia nigra decreases considerably with age. At 20 weeks, there is very little stain in the substantia nigra. There is more variability in X-gal staining in the substan-tia nigra of adult 8-week-old animals than in the X-gal stain in other brain regions. We see a subset of cells double labeled with X-gal and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreac-tivity. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Drs.
